# Worked examples: the de Finetti public API

This file imports **only** `TauCeti.Probability.DeFinetti`, and that is its whole content: each
example is a bare reference to a name Layer 7 advertises, so the file elaborates exactly when the
curated facade exports everything it promises. Nothing is proved and nothing is declared; the
import is not public, so this adds no second route to the API.

A failure here means an export went missing, not that a proof broke: a summit can be proved, and
its module built, while the facade never re-exports it, leaving the name unreachable for a caller
who imports only the facade.

## One advertised name does not exist

Layer 7 spells one endpoint `exchangeable_of_mixedIID`; the repository proves it canonically as
`MixedIID.exchangeable`, which is checked below under that name. No alias is introduced.

`deFinetti_empiricalMeasure` is not currently exported. Unlike the topology-free fixed-set endpoint
below, its weak-convergence statement requires an explicitly chosen compatible Polish topology,
which `[StandardBorelSpace α]` alone does not select.

Every other advertised name is checked below.

## The mathematical worked examples live elsewhere

The roadmap's worked-example list is discharged with the objects each concerns, not here: the
conditionally i.i.d. coin-flip construction in `Exchangeability/ConditionallyIID/CoinFlips.lean`,
the constant-witness characterisation of i.i.d. in `ConditionallyIID/Const.lean`, and the
stationary but non-exchangeable 3-cycle in `Exchangeability/ThreeCycle.lean`.

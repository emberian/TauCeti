# Finitely presented sheaves on schemes

This file packages Mathlib's finite-presentation condition for sheaves of modules as a full
subcategory on an arbitrary scheme. On a locally Noetherian scheme this supplies the objects used
in the standard coherent-sheaf notion.

The main declarations are:

* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.FinitelyPresentedSheaf X`, the full subcategory of finitely
  presented objects in `X.Modules`;
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.InvertibleSheaf.toFinitelyPresented`, the fully faithful inclusion
  of invertible sheaves into finitely presented sheaves.

The inclusion uses the site-level theorem that an invertible sheaf is finitely presented: its
rank-one local trivializations give finite generators and have no relations. Thus the existing
Layer A line-bundle objects can be consumed by the coherent-cohomology theory planned in Layer B.

This advances `TauCetiRoadmap/JacobianChallenge/README.md`, Layer B, item "Coherent sheaves and
cohomology `Hⁱ(X, ℱ)`", while supplying the direct bridge from Layer A's invertible sheaves.
No formalization is vendored. The definition reuses Mathlib's
`SheafOfModules.IsFinitePresentation` and `ObjectProperty.FullSubcategory`.

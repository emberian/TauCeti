# Subtraction of fixed-degree effective Weil divisors

This file records the residual effective divisor obtained by subtracting an effective
sub-divisor from a fixed-degree effective Weil divisor. If `E ≤ D`, with `D` of degree `e`
and `E` of degree `d`, then `D - E` is effective of degree `e - d`. The cancellation lemmas
show that adding the residual back recovers the original divisor, up to the unavoidable casts
in the natural-number degree index.

This is formal divisor bookkeeping for the Jacobian challenge roadmap's Layer C symmetric-power
lane (`TauCetiRoadmap/JacobianChallenge/README.md`, "Relative effective Cartier divisors and
symmetric powers `Symᵈ X`"). The scheme-level construction is later geometry; this file supplies
the elementary residual-divisor API used when separating a fixed effective base divisor from an
unordered collection of points. No external mathematics is vendored.

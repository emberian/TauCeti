# Fixed-degree positive and negative parts of a Weil divisor

This file packages the positive and negative parts of a formal Weil divisor as fixed-degree
effective divisors.  The order file proves that every formal divisor decomposes as
`D = D⁺ - D⁻`, with both parts effective and with disjoint support.  The fixed-degree divisor
API, in turn, is the formal model for symmetric powers.  The declarations here bridge those two
layers by turning `D⁺` and `D⁻` into `EffectiveDivisorOfDegree` terms with their actual degrees
as indices.

This is formal divisor bookkeeping for the Jacobian challenge roadmap's Layer A and Layer C:
`TauCetiRoadmap/JacobianChallenge/README.md`, specifically "Divisors on a curve: Weil divisors
`⊕_x ℤ`", "Degree", and the symmetric-power prerequisite "Relative effective Cartier divisors
and symmetric powers `Symᵈ X`".  No external mathematics is vendored; the proofs reuse Tau
Ceti's `WeilDivisor.Order` positive/negative-part API and the existing
`EffectiveDivisorOfDegree` packaging.

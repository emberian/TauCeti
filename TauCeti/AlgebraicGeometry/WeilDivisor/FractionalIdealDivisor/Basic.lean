# The Weil divisor of an invertible fractional ideal

For a Dedekind domain `R` with fraction field `K`,
`TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.WeilDivisor.Dedekind.Basic` turns the height-one spectrum of `R` into the
points of an affine curve and packages the order of vanishing of a rational function as the order
system `OrderSystem.ofDedekindDomain R K`. This basic module adds the *Cartier* side of that
picture: invertible fractional ideals of `R` are the Cartier divisors of the affine curve, and this
file identifies them with Weil divisors.

Concretely, a nonzero fractional ideal `I` has a well-defined `v`-adic multiplicity
`FractionalIdeal.count K v I` at each height-one prime `v`, zero for all but finitely many `v`, so
the assignment `v ↦ count K v I` is a Weil divisor. Because `count` is additive on products, this
gives a homomorphism

`fractionalIdealDivisor : Additive (FractionalIdeal R⁰ K)ˣ →+ WeilDivisor (HeightOneSpectrum R)`

from the group of invertible fractional ideals (every nonzero fractional ideal of a Dedekind domain
is invertible, `FractionalIdeal R⁰ K` being a semifield) to the free Weil-divisor group. This
homomorphism is an **isomorphism**: a fractional ideal is recovered from its multiplicities by the
factorization `I = ∏_v v^(count K v I)` (injectivity), and every finite integer combination of
primes is the divisor of the corresponding product of prime ideals (surjectivity). This is the
scheme-free, affine-chart form of the roadmap's **`Weil ≃ Cartier` dictionary**. Injectivity is
also recorded coefficientwise as `units_eq_of_forall_count_eq`, the form in which it is used: to
prove two invertible fractional ideals equal, compare `count` at each prime.

We also connect it to the order system already built: the divisor of the principal fractional ideal
`(x)` is exactly the principal divisor of the rational function `x`, so the isomorphism carries the
principal fractional ideals to the principal divisors. This is the compatibility on principal
elements needed before passing to quotient-level statements, which are not proved in this file.
The divisor of a prime `v` is the point divisor `[v]`, the sanity check that rules out a
vacuous map.

This advances `TauCetiRoadmap/JacobianChallenge/README.md`, Layer A, "Divisors on a curve",
specifically the "(smooth curve) `Weil ≃ Cartier`" dictionary realized here for the affine
Dedekind model. It reuses
Mathlib's `FractionalIdeal.count` factorization API (`count_mul`, `count_finsuppProd`,
`finprod_heightOneSpectrum_factorization'`, `count_maximal_coprime`) and Tau Ceti's `WeilDivisor`
and `OrderSystem.ofDedekindDomain` API; no external mathematics is vendored.

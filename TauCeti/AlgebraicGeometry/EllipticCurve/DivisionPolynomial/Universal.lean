# Division polynomials of the universal curve

Every Weierstrass curve is a specialization of the universal one, and division polynomials commute
with base change. Composing the two identifies the division polynomials of a curve `W` over `R`,
evaluated at a point `(x, y)` of the affine plane, with those of `Universal.curve` pushed forward
along `Universal.polyEval`.

Each proof is the same two steps: unfold `polyEval` into a `map` followed by `evalEval`
(`polyEval_apply`), then rewrite the base change of the universal curve back to `W`
(`map_specialize`). The division polynomial in between is carried across by the relevant Mathlib
`map_*` lemma.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.evalEval_ψ₂`, `.evalEval_Ψ₃`, `.evalEval_preΨ₄`, `.evalEval_ψ`,
  `.evalEval_φ`: the polynomials `ψ₂`, `Ψ₃`, `ψₙ` and `φₙ` of `W` at `(x, y)`, together with the
  auxiliary `preΨ₄`, are the universal ones evaluated through `Universal.polyEval`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.isEllipticSequence_polyToField_ψ`: the universal `ψ` family, taken
  into `Universal.Field`, is an elliptic sequence.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.polyEval_cusp_ψ`, `.polyEval_cusp_φ`: specialised to the cusp curve
  at `(1, 1)`, `ψₙ` evaluates to `n` itself and the numerator `φₙ` to `1`.

## Implementation notes

`Ψ₃` and `preΨ₄` are univariate, so their statements evaluate `C W.Ψ₃` rather than `W.Ψ₃`; the two
extra rewrites in those proofs (`map_C`, `coe_mapRingHom`) only move that `C` past the base change.

`polyEval_cusp_ψ` is where the three transport lemmas above earn their keep. `Cusp.lean` collapses
`ψ₂`, `Ψ₃` and `preΨ₄` on `cusp R` to `2Y`, `3X⁴` and `2X⁶`; rewriting the transports backwards
turns `polyEval (cusp ℤ) 1 1 (curve.ψ n)` into those three evaluated at `(1, 1)`, which are `2`,
`3` and `2` — so the sequence is `normEDS 2 3 2`, and the identity of #3364 finishes it. That is
the only reason this file imports `Cusp.lean`.

**`polyEval_cusp_φ` does not port as written, and the reason is the module system rather than a
missing prerequisite.** The source closes it with `simp_rw [φ, map_sub, …, polyEval]`, unfolding
`polyEval`'s definition, which is rejected across a module boundary — *"Invalid simp theorem
`polyEval`: Expected a definition with an exposed body"*. Supplying the equation lemma instead does
not help either: `polyEval`'s image lives in `Poly`, whose `Sub` and `Mul` instances are themselves
unexposed, so a bare `map_sub` cannot solve `?f` in the pattern `?f (?a - ?b)` and fails to fire at
all. **Naming the ring hom is what fixes it** — `map_sub (polyEval (cusp ℤ) 1 1)` makes the match
first-order, and the same for `map_mul` and `map_pow`. That leaves the arithmetic
`polyEval (cusp ℤ) 1 1 (C X) * n ^ 2 - (n + 1) * (n - 1) = 1`, which `ring` closes once `C X`
evaluates to `1`.

The remaining two companions, `polyEval_cusp_ψc` and `polyEval_cusp_ω`, need `ψc` and `two_mul_ω`,
both part of the `ω` API that `DivisionPolynomial/Invariant.lean` records as not yet here. Those are
ordinary missing prerequisites and arrive with `ω`.

The companion transport for `ω` is **not** here. It cannot be: `WeierstrassCurve.ω` does not exist
in this repository or in the pinned Mathlib, and neither does the `map_ω` such a proof would rewrite
with. `DivisionPolynomial/Invariant.lean` lists both among what it deliberately leaves out, and
records the chain still missing for them — the top of
`redInvar_normEDS ← invar₂_normEDS ← invar_normEDS ← net_normEDS`, the source's names for it; the
denominator itself has landed as `reducedInvarDenom`. The
lower three links are `isEllipticNet_normEDS`, `invarNum_mul_invarDenom` and
`IsEllipticNet.invarNum_normEDS_one_mul_eq_invarDenom_mul`, all present, so what remains is
`redInvar_normEDS`. `evalEval_ω` belongs with that work rather than here.

## Provenance

Adapted from `LutzNagell/ZSMul.lean` in AINTLIB (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0),
at `dev/modular-curves @ 9fec8eba7652` — the revision `TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`
pins for the NagellLutz project. Declarations `Universal.evalEval_ψ₂`, `evalEval_Ψ₃`,
`evalEval_preΨ₄`, `evalEval_ψ` and `evalEval_φ`; the sixth, `evalEval_ω`, is excluded for the
reason above. `isEllipticSequence_polyToField_ψ` adapts that same file's `isEllSequence_ψᵤ`.
That file's header reads `Authors: David Kurniadi Angdinata, Junyan Xu`; following this
repository's convention for adapted material the upstream authorship is credited here rather than
in the copyright header.

`polyEval_cusp_ψ` and `polyEval_cusp_φ` adapt that same file's declarations of those names, at the
roadmap's NagellLutz pin `dev/modular-curves @ 9fec8eba7652`. Three changes. `ψ` and `φ` need
qualifying, because this file opens `Universal` rather than `WeierstrassCurve` alone. The source's
`normEDS_two_three_two` hint is dropped rather than renamed — `normEDS_two_three_two_eq_id` is
redundant here, since #3364's general `normEDS_two_three_two_eq_intCast` is `@[simp]` and reaches
the same normal form first. And `polyEval_cusp_φ`'s proof is restructured for the reason given
above: the source's unfold of `polyEval` is unavailable, so each `map_*` names its ring hom.
The source's `polyEval_cusp_ψc` and `polyEval_cusp_ω` are excluded.

The `evalEval_*` statements are the source's unchanged. Docstrings are added here, and the
source's shared `variable {m n : ℤ}` is narrowed to `n`: of those five only `evalEval_ψ` and
`evalEval_φ` carry an index, and both use `n` alone. `isEllSequence_ψᵤ` is stated upstream through
an `abbrev ψᵤ` and its own `ψᵤ_eq_normEDS`; here the abbreviation is dropped and that equation is
inlined as a `have`, so the statement is spelled on `fun n ↦ polyToField (curve.ψ n)` directly.

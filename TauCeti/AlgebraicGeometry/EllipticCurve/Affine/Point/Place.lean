# Solutions of a Weierstrass equation are its degree-one affine places

For an affine Weierstrass curve `W` over a field whose coordinate ring is a Dedekind domain, the
ideal `⟨X - x, Y - y⟩ = XYIdeal W x (C y)` of a solution `(x, y)` of `W.Equation` is maximal and
nonzero. It is therefore a point of `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum W.CoordinateRing`, which
is Mathlib's type of nonzero primes and carries the adic valuation on the function field.

This file builds that place and identifies which places arise: exactly those of **degree one**, the
degree of a place being the rank of its residue field over the base field. A point has degree one
because the quotient by its ideal is the base field, by Mathlib's `quotientXYIdealEquiv`; the
converse ideal-level classification is in `XYIdealMaximal.lean`. The Dedekind hypothesis enters
only in the packaging, where the places are named.

The degree hypothesis is part of the statement, not a convenience: a place of degree `d > 1` has
a residue field of degree `d` over `F` and is the place of no rational point at all. It is only
over an algebraically closed base that every place has degree one, so that points correspond to
*all* nonzero primes.

When `W` is elliptic, Mathlib's `Affine.equation_iff_nonsingular` identifies the solutions of
`W.Equation` with the affine points in `W.toAffine.Point`, namely the points other than `0`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.pointPlace`: the place — the height-one prime of
  the coordinate ring — attached to a point of the curve, built with Mathlib's
  `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.ofPrime`.
* `TauCeti.WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.equationEquivDegreeOnePlace`: **the affine
  point–place dictionary** — `pointPlace` as an equivalence between solutions of `W.Equation`
  and the degree-one places.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.pointPlace_asIdeal`: a `@[simp]` lemma
  identifying the ideal underlying `pointPlace` as `XYIdeal W x (C y)`.
* `TauCeti.WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.pointPlace_eq_iff`: `pointPlace` is injective —
  two points have the same place exactly when they have the same coordinates.
* `TauCeti.WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.pointPlace.finrank_residueField_eq_one`: the
  place of a point has degree one.
* `TauCeti.WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.exists_pointPlace_eq`: conversely, every
  degree-one place is the place of a point.

`(pointPlace h).valuation W.FunctionField` is then the associated multiplicative adic valuation on
the function field, taking values in `ℤᵐ⁰` and normalised so that a uniformiser has value
`WithZero.exp (-1)`; the order of vanishing is its negative logarithm. Mathlib's `Valuation` API —
multiplicativity, the ultrametric inequality, vanishing exactly at `0`, and the existence of a
uniformiser — comes with it.

## Roadmap

`TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`, **Layer 0** (the function field, places, and divisors),
whose §Places asks for the affine places as the maximal ideals of the coordinate ring together with
an API of `ord_v` and uniformisers, and for the point–place dictionary: "for elliptic `W`,
`W.toAffine.Point` is in bijection with the degree-`1` places: `O ↦ infinityPlace`, and an affine
nonsingular `(x₀, y₀) ↦` the maximal ideal `(X − x₀, Y − y₀)`". This is the affine half of that
dictionary at the level of equation solutions; for elliptic `W`, `equation_iff_nonsingular`
identifies its domain with the nonzero affine points. The place at infinity
(`TauCeti.WeierstrassCurve.Affine.infinityPlace`) is a valuation on the function field rather than
a prime of the coordinate ring, so the two are not yet terms of one type of places, although they
are already known to be distinct places
(`TauCeti.WeierstrassCurve.Affine.infinityPlace_ne_heightOneSpectrum_valuation`). The point at
infinity therefore stays out of the dictionary here: reading it on the whole point group `W.Point`
has to wait for Layer 0 to fix one type of places holding both `infinityPlace` and the affine ones,
and is what remains of the milestone. The layer seeds no declaration this competes with, and
records that the design is coordinated with D. Angdinata's in-flight upstream `CoordinateRing`
work.

## Provenance

The degree-one result corresponds to AINTLIB's `HasseWeil/Curves/ResidueFieldAtSmoothPoint.lean`
(`SmoothPlaneCurve.quotientAlgEquivBase`, `SmoothPlaneCurve.residueFieldsAlgEquiv`,
`CurveMap.CoordHom.inertiaDeg_eq_one_of_isAlgClosed`). There it is reached through the
`SmoothPlaneCurve`/`SmoothPoint` wrappers with the residue field built by hand, and the residue
degree additionally assumes an algebraically closed base; here the wrappers are dropped, the
hypothesis is the curve equation, no closure is needed, and the content is Mathlib's
`quotientXYIdealEquiv` rather than a fresh construction.

The place itself is not a port. AINTLIB's `HasseWeil/Curves/Valuation.lean` builds an `ord_P` for
its own
`SmoothPlaneCurve` wrapper with about twenty lemmas — multiplicativity, the ultrametric bound,
inverses, powers, uniformisers. None of that is reproduced: once the point is presented as a
`HeightOneSpectrum`, those are Mathlib's `Valuation.map_mul`, `Valuation.map_add`,
`Valuation.zero_iff`, `Valuation.map_inv`, `Valuation.map_add_of_distinct_val` and
`IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.valuation_exists_uniformizer`.

The packaged equivalence corresponds to AINTLIB's `smoothPointEquivHeightOneSpectrum` in
`projects/HasseWeil/HasseWeil/Foundation/Curves/Valuation/SmoothPointPrime.lean`
(`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB @ 1c1c74664e40`, Apache-2.0; Authors: Chris Birkbeck). That version
uses `SmoothPlaneCurve` and `SmoothPoint` wrappers, assumes a maximal-ideal hypothesis and
`[IsAlgClosed F]`, and reaches all height-one primes. Here the domain is the equation-solution
subtype and the codomain is the degree-one places over an arbitrary field. The preceding
"not a port" statement concerns only the `ord_P` valuation API.

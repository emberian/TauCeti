# The Frobenius isogeny

Over a finite field `F` with `q = Nat.card F` elements, raising to the `q`-th power is an
`F`-algebra endomorphism of any `F`-algebra (`FiniteField.frobeniusAlgHom`). Composing it with
the embedding of the coordinate ring into the function field gives a coordinate pullback, and
that pullback maps infinity to infinity, so it is an isogeny of `W` with itself. Its degree
is `q`.

The declarations take `[Finite F]` rather than `[Fintype F]`, matching
`Affine/FrobeniusTower.lean`, and state the exponent as `Nat.card F`: a `Fintype` instance is
chosen enumeration data, and neither the definitions nor the statements should depend on it. The
instance Mathlib's map needs is installed locally where it is required.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Isogeny.frobeniusPullback`: the coordinate pullback `x ↦ x ^ q`.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.frobeniusIsogeny`: the same map packaged as an `Isogeny W W`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Isogeny.fieldPullback_frobeniusIsogeny`: the induced map of function fields is the
  `q`-power map `FiniteField.frobeniusAlgHom F W.FunctionField`.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.degree_frobeniusIsogeny`: the Frobenius isogeny has degree `q`.

The `MapsInfinity` condition says that each `x` of the coordinate ring is integral over the
pulled-back copy. It holds because `x` is a `q`-th root of its own pullback, so `IsIntegral.of_pow`
reduces it to integrality of an element the pullback already produces. That is what "Frobenius
fixes the point at infinity" amounts to here.

The degree is the field-theoretic
`TauCeti.WeierstrassCurve.Affine.finrank_fieldRange_frobeniusAlgHom`, `[K(W) : K(W)^q] = q`,
transported along the identification of `fieldPullback` with the `q`-power map on `K(W)`. That
identification is `Isogeny.fieldPullback_unique`: both maps restrict to `x ↦ x ^ q` on the
coordinate ring, and only one extension to the fraction field exists.

This is the `frobeniusIsogeny` seed of `TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md` §Layer 1, where
it is described as "`f ↦ f ^ q` out of the coordinate ring into the function field … whose
`MapsInfinity` is the integrality of the coordinates over their `q`-th powers". The seed follows
Silverman, *The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves*, II.2.11, whose part (c) is the degree. The
roadmap's `Suggested.lean` states both with `sorry`; the proofs here are original.

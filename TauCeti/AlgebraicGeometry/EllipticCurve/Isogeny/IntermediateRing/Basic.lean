# The intermediate ring of an isogeny

The integral closure of the target coordinate ring inside the source function field, taken along
an isogeny's pullback. This is the normalization that `CoordinatePullback.MapsInfinity` names,
and it receives both coordinate rings: the target's through the pullback, and the source's
because `mapsInfinity` is precisely the assertion that it lands there.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Isogeny.intermediateRing`: the integral closure of `W₂.CoordinateRing` in
  `W₁.FunctionField` along `φ.pullback`.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.toIntermediateRing` and `TauCeti.Isogeny.pullbackToIntermediateRing`: the two
  coordinate rings corestricted into it, along which ideals are extended and the relative norm
  is taken.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Isogeny.algebraMap_mem_intermediateRing`: the source coordinate ring lands in it.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.pullback_mem_intermediateRing`: so does the target coordinate ring.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.isIntegralClosure_intermediateRing`: it really is the integral closure, in
  Mathlib's `IsIntegralClosure` sense.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.isScalarTower_intermediateRing`: the corestricted pullback puts it in a scalar
  tower under `W₂.CoordinateRing`, which is the other half of a consumer's setup.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.id_intermediateRing`: an identity isogeny's intermediate ring is the
  coordinate ring itself, sitting inside its own fraction field.

## Design

The result is a `Subring W₁.FunctionField`, not a `Subalgebra`. The algebra structure that
`φ.pullback` induces on `W₁.FunctionField` is deliberately not a global instance — different
isogenies induce different ones, so registering any would be a diamond, as `Isogeny/Basic.lean`
explains. A `Subalgebra` would put that structure into the *type*, forcing every statement about
the object to fix a choice of it; a `Subring` keeps it inside the definition, exactly where
`MapsInfinity` already keeps it.

The two corestrictions are plain `RingHom`s rather than an `Algebra W₂.CoordinateRing`
instance on the intermediate ring. An algebra *instance* would reintroduce the diamond the
`Subring` choice exists to avoid, since the structure it would register is the pullback-induced
one; a bundled map carries the same information to consumers without registering anything.

Nothing here assumes separability, so purely inseparable isogenies such as Frobenius are covered.
`id_intermediateRing` is stated for an integrally closed coordinate ring rather than an elliptic
one, which is all its proof uses; the elliptic case is that hypothesis discharged by
`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.isIntegrallyClosed_coordinateRing`, and is not given a separate name
because nothing would consume it.

The structural theory of this ring is not proved here. Module-finiteness over `W₂.CoordinateRing`
is in the sibling `IntermediateRing/Finite.lean` as `moduleFinite_intermediateRing`, for a
separable function-field extension; Dedekindness is still absent. Every route to either in Mathlib
(`IsIntegralClosure.finite`, `integralClosure.isDedekindDomain`) carries an `Algebra.IsSeparable`
hypothesis, so the inseparable case — which is expected to be true, by Noether's finiteness
theorem for the module-finiteness half — remains separate work rather than a corollary of the
definition.

This opens the "points come along" milestone of Layer 1 of
`TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`, which names this object as "the **intermediate ring**
— the integral closure of `W₂.CoordinateRing` in `W₁.FunctionField`, the normalization
`mapsInfinity` names", receiving both coordinate rings on the way to `pushClass` and
`toPointHom`. It follows Silverman, *The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves*, II.2.

## Provenance

The choice of object is taken from the AINTLIB project (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, at
revision `2baa76f742bdb4fb8ee323fabba41203bd390e08`, Apache 2.0 per the source file's header, by
Chris Birkbeck): `projects/HasseWeil/HasseWeil/Curves/NormConormIntegralClosure.lean`, which
introduces `B := integralClosure C₂.CoordinateRing C₁.FunctionField` and carries its structural
instances `instDedekindB`, `instModuleFiniteB`, `instFractionRingB` and `instTorsionFreeB`, proved
in `projects/HasseWeil/HasseWeil/Curves/RamificationFinite.lean`.

What is adapted here is the object and the observation that the integral closure over the
*coordinate* ring — rather than over a localization — is the right home for the norm and
class-group route to the induced map on points. Of the structural instances, only
module-finiteness is ported, and in the sibling `IntermediateRing/Finite.lean` rather than here,
under the source's own `[Algebra.IsSeparable K L]`; the rest are not. The source proves them for
a fixed extension with the algebra structures supplied as instance arguments, whereas this file
takes the pullback-induced structure locally and assumes no separability. None of the declarations
below is a transcription of a source declaration.

supplies the `Algebra`, and this supplies the `IsScalarTower` that every downstream statement over
the intermediate ring also asks for. -/

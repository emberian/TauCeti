# The universal elliptic curve

This file defines the universal Weierstrass curve (`Universal.curve`) over the
polynomial ring `ℤ[A₁,A₂,A₃,A₄,A₆]`, and the universal pointed elliptic curve
(`Universal.pointedCurve`) over the field of fractions (`Universal.Field`) of
`Universal.Ring = Universal.Poly/⟨P⟩ = ℤ[A₁,A₂,A₃,A₄,A₆,X,Y]/⟨P⟩` (where `P` is the Weierstrass
polynomial) with distinguished point `(X,Y)`.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.curve`: the universal Weierstrass curve, over `ℤ[A₁,⋯,A₆]`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.Poly`, `.Ring`, `.Field`: the polynomial ring `ℤ[A₁,⋯,A₆,X,Y]`, its
  quotient by the Weierstrass polynomial, and that quotient's field of fractions; `polyToField` is
  the composite `Poly →+* Field`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.pointedCurve`: the universal curve over `Universal.Field`. It is an
  elliptic curve, and carries the distinguished point `Universal.Affine.point`
  (`Universal.Jacobian.point` in Jacobian coordinates).
* `WeierstrassCurve.specialize`: for a Weierstrass curve `W` over a commutative ring `R`, the
  specialization homomorphism `ℤ[A₁,⋯,A₆] →+* R` substituting `W`'s coefficients.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.polyEval`, `.ringEval`: the homomorphism `Universal.Poly →+* R`
  induced by a point `(x,y)` of the affine plane, and its factorisation `Universal.Ring →+* R`
  through the Weierstrass polynomial when `(x,y)` lies on `W`.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.equation_point`: `(X,Y)` satisfies the affine Weierstrass equation
  of `pointedCurve` — the universal curve really is pointed.
* `WeierstrassCurve.map_specialize`: every Weierstrass curve is a specialization of the universal
  one.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.map_ringEval`: pushing the universal curve over
  `Universal.Ring` along `ringEval` returns `W`, so one identity **over `curveRing`** is the same
  identity for every curve and every point on it. Note the restriction: `ringEval` maps out of
  `Universal.Ring`, so it transports identities over `curveRing`, not over `pointedCurve`, which
  lives over `Universal.Field`. An identity stated there needs its denominators cleared into
  `Universal.Ring` first.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.ringHom_ext`: two homomorphisms out of `Universal.Ring` agreeing on
  the coefficient ring and on the two distinguished coordinates are equal — the uniqueness half of
  the universal property, since those generate.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.algebraMap_field_injective`: `ℤ[A₁,⋯,A₆]` embeds in
  `Universal.Field`, which is what makes `pointedCurve` an elliptic curve.

## Implementation notes

The cusp curve `Y² = X³` carries the rational point `(1,1)`, with the nice property that
`ψₙ(1,1) = n`. Specializing along it is therefore the cheap route to nonvanishing of the universal
`ψₙ` for `n ≠ 0`, which shows that `(X,Y)` is a point of infinite order on the universal pointed
elliptic curve. The `CharZero Universal.Ring` instance is the first use of that argument.

## Roadmap

The `[n]`-is-division-polynomials bullet of `TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`'s opening
narrative on isogenies asks for multiplication by `n ≠ 0` as an isogeny of degree `n²` whose
pullback is "pinned by the division-polynomial multiplication formula, already proved at the point
level in the Lutz–Nagell provenance through J. Xu's work (mathlib #13782 / `ZSMul.lean`) — the
mathlib-track anchor Layer 1 consumes". This file is the `Universal.Ring` prerequisite of that
`ZSMul.lean`: `ringEval` is what turns a single identity **over `curveRing`** into the same
identity for every Weierstrass curve and every point on it, so the point-level
`[n]`-compatibility is proved once, universally, rather than curve by curve. It maps out of
`Universal.Ring`; identities over `pointedCurve`, which is over `Universal.Field`, transport only
after their denominators are cleared into `Universal.Ring`. Mathlib PR #13782 is
still open, so the whole `Universal` namespace below is absent from Mathlib.

## Provenance

Ported from J. Xu's `LutzNagell/Universal.lean` in AINTLIB (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`,
Apache 2.0, `main` at `1c1c7466`, `projects/NagellLutz/LutzNagell/Universal.lean`), the source the
roadmap pins for the Nagell–Lutz strand. **Most** declarations here come from that file: the
`Coeff` index type and the bulk of the `Universal` namespace (`curve`, `Poly`, `Ring`, `Field`,
`polyToField`, `pointedCurve`, `Affine.point`, `Jacobian.point`, `curvePoly` and `curveRing` with
their lemmas), and the specialization API (`specialize`, `polyEval`, `ringEval` with their
compatibility lemmas).

Three groups are **not** simple ports, and are listed among the adaptations below: `ringHom_ext`
is new; the `CharZero Universal.Ring` instance **replaces** the source's `Poly.two_ne_zero` and
`Field.two_ne_zero` rather than porting them, and carries the field case with it — Mathlib derives
`CharZero Universal.Field` from it through `IsFractionRing`, so no second instance is declared; and
the equation lemmas for the opaque definitions
(`polyToField_apply`, `Affine.point_def`, `Jacobian.point_def`, `pointedCurve_Δ`) exist because
this repository's module system leaves definition bodies unexposed.
That file's header reads `Authors: Junyan Xu`; following this repository's convention for adapted
material, the upstream authorship is credited here rather than in the copyright header.

Four adaptations were made. The file was converted to this repository's module system (`module`,
`public import`, `public section`). The source's three opening lemmas —
`CoordinateRing.algebraMap_poly_injective`, `CoordinateRing.algebraMap_injective'` and
`Affine.Point.some_eq_some_iff` — are **not** ported: the first two are
`FaithfulSMul.algebraMap_injective` applied to Mathlib's own `FaithfulSMul` instances on the
coordinate ring, and the third is the `Iff` reading of the auto-generated `some.injEq`, which `simp`
proves alone. This repository declines such wrappers, and had already declined the analogous
instances in `Affine/FunctionField/Finrank.lean`; the one internal use, in
`algebraMap_field_injective`, calls `FaithfulSMul.algebraMap_injective` directly. Dropping them also
removes the source's `set_option backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency false in`, which existed only
for the first of them and which `TauCeti/` forbids in any case.
No definition in this file is exposed. `polyToField_apply`, `algebraMap_field_eq_comp`, the five
`pointedCurve_aᵢ` lemmas and the two `point_def` lemmas are proved `:= (rfl)`: the parentheses
satisfy the module system's export check without publishing any body, which is what an `@[expose]`
would do. The section is a plain `public section` for the reason spelled out in
`TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/Affine/Point/VariableChange.lean` — exposing the whole file
would publish every proof body to make a handful of `rfl`s go through. And `equation_point` opens
with `change` where the source has `show`, that step rewriting the goal rather than only naming it
(`linter.style.show`).

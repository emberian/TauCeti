# The node polynomial of a Weierstrass curve

When a Weierstrass curve degenerates to a node, the two tangent directions there are the roots of a
quadratic, and the reduction is called *split* exactly when those roots are rational over the
residue field. Mathlib writes that quadratic out inline, in the very definition of
`WeierstrassCurve.HasSplitMultiplicativeReduction`
(`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/Reduction.lean`, applied to `W.integralModel R`), but
gives it no name and proves nothing about it. This file names it `WeierstrassCurve.nodePolynomial`
and says when it splits, supplying the criterion the TODO just above that class asks for — *"add
characterization in terms of the discriminant when the characteristic is not 2"* — together with
the characteristic-two counterpart the TODO does not ask for. Restating the class itself through
these criteria needs `integralModel` and belongs to the minimal-model slice, so the TODO is
answered at the level of the polynomial, not yet of the class.

* `WeierstrassCurve.nodePolynomial` is `c₄ T² + a₁ c₄ T - (54 b₆ - 3 b₂ b₄ + a₂ c₄)`, defined over
  any commutative ring;
* `WeierstrassCurve.nodePolynomial_coeff_zero` reads off the constant coefficient, which is *minus*
  `54 b₆ - 3 b₂ b₄ + a₂ c₄` since the definition subtracts that combination. It is the projection
  through which `QuadraticTwist.lean` states how twisting moves this coefficient;
* `WeierstrassCurve.discrim_nodePolynomial` computes its discriminant as `-c₄ c₆`. This is the
  number the twist lane needs: twisting by `(t, n)` scales `-c₄ c₆` by `(t² - 4n)⁵`, i.e. by the
  twisting parameter times a square, so twisting by the right square class moves the discriminant
  into the squares;
* `WeierstrassCurve.map_nodePolynomial` is naturality, `(W.map φ).nodePolynomial =
  W.nodePolynomial.map φ`. It is what lets the criteria below — stated for `W.nodePolynomial.map φ`,
  i.e. for the *reduction* of the node polynomial — be read as statements about the node polynomial
  of the reduced curve;
* `WeierstrassCurve.variableChange_nodePolynomial` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.splits_variableChange_nodePolynomial_map_iff`: a change of variables `(u, r, s,
  t)` transforms the node polynomial by the affine substitution `T ↦ u T + s` and the unit scalar
  `u⁻⁶`, so whether it splits is an isomorphism invariant. This is why split multiplicative
  reduction is a property of the curve and not of the equation;
* `WeierstrassCurve.splits_nodePolynomial_map_iff_isSquare` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.splits_nodePolynomial_map_iff_exists_artinSchreier_of_two_eq_zero`: the
  splitting criteria themselves, each needing only `c₄` to survive the map. Away from residue
  characteristic two it splits iff the image of `-c₄ c₆` is a square; in residue characteristic
  two, where that says nothing, iff an Artin-Schreier condition holds. Both come from the general
  quadratic criteria of `TauCeti/Algebra/Polynomial/QuadraticDiscriminant.lean`.

Nothing here assumes a valuation or a reduction: every statement is about a Weierstrass curve over
a commutative ring and a ring homomorphism to a field, so it applies to any reduction map one later
chooses. They advance `TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md` §Layer 5 (twists), whose headline
`exists_quadraticTwist_hasSplitMultiplicativeReduction` — a curve with nonsplit multiplicative
reduction acquires split reduction after a separable quadratic twist — carries no residue-
characteristic hypothesis, so it needs both criteria: away from residue characteristic two one
feeds the twist's scaling of `-c₄ c₆` into `splits_nodePolynomial_map_iff_isSquare`, and in residue
characteristic two the route is
`splits_nodePolynomial_map_iff_exists_artinSchreier_of_two_eq_zero`.

/-- The **node polynomial** `c₄ T² + a₁ c₄ T - (54 b₆ - 3 b₂ b₄ + a₂ c₄)`, whose roots are the
slopes of the two tangent directions at the node of a multiplicative reduction. This is the
polynomial Mathlib writes out inline in `WeierstrassCurve.HasSplitMultiplicativeReduction`, which
asks for the splitting over the residue field of this polynomial formed from the *integral model*
`W.integralModel R`, as its one extra condition on top of `HasMultiplicativeReduction`. -/

/-- The defining formula for the node polynomial. The definition's body is not exposed across the
module boundary, so this is how downstream modules see it;
`nodePolynomial_map_eq_quadratic` is the corresponding statement for its image under a ring
homomorphism. -/
lemma nodePolynomial_def (W : WeierstrassCurve A) :
    W.nodePolynomial = .C W.c₄ * .X ^ 2 + .C (W.a₁ * W.c₄) * .X

/-- The constant coefficient of the node polynomial. Note the sign: `nodePolynomial` *subtracts*
`54 b₆ - 3 b₂ b₄ + a₂ c₄`, so `coeff 0` is minus that combination, not it.

Deliberately not `@[simp]`: the normal form wanted downstream rewrites a twisted curve's
coefficient back to the base curve's (`nodePolynomial_coeff_zero_quadraticTwistOf`), and that
lemma's left-hand side is exactly this one's, so tagging both would make the twist lemma
non-normal-form. -/

/-- The discriminant of the node polynomial is `-c₄ c₆`. Hence — away from residue characteristic
two, and provided `c₄` survives the reduction — the tangent directions at the node are rational
over the residue field exactly when the image of `-c₄ c₆` is a square there
(`splits_nodePolynomial_map_iff_isSquare`); twisting by `(t, n)` multiplies `-c₄ c₆` by
`(t² - 4n)⁵ = (t² - 4n)⁴ · (t² - 4n)`, i.e. by the twisting parameter up to a square. -/

/-- **Invariance of the node polynomial's splitting under change of variables.** Since a change of
variables transforms the node polynomial by an affine substitution and a unit scalar
(`variableChange_nodePolynomial`), whether it splits over a field `k` is unchanged. This is what

equation. -/

/-- **Split criterion away from residue characteristic two.** Over a field `k` with `2 ≠ 0`, and
provided `c₄` does not die under `φ` — the condition that makes the reduced polynomial genuinely
quadratic, and which multiplicative reduction supplies — the node polynomial splits, i.e. the two
tangent directions at the node are `k`-rational, exactly when `φ (-(c₄ * c₆))`, the image of its
discriminant (`discrim_nodePolynomial`), is a square in `k`. This answers Mathlib's TODO in
`Reduction.lean` at the level of the node polynomial; restating
`HasSplitMultiplicativeReduction` itself through it needs `integralModel`. It is also the tool
that, applied to a quadratic twist via the scaling
`-c₄' c₆' = (t² - 4n)⁵ · (-c₄ c₆)`, turns a nonsplit reduction into a split one after twisting by
the right square class. -/

Only `c₄` need be assumed nonzero: in characteristic two `1728 = 0`, so `c_relation` reads
`c₄³ = c₆²` and `c₆ ≠ 0` comes for free. Together they force the linear coefficient `a₁ c₄` to be
nonzero, which is what makes the criterion applicable. -/

# The endomorphism ring of the trivial abelian variety

The trivial abelian variety `AbelianVariety.trivial K` has a unique endomorphism, so its
endomorphism ring is the zero ring and the multiplication-by-`n` endomorphism `[n]` is the identity
for every `n` — a check that the construction of
`TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.AbelianVariety.End.Basic` is not vacuous.

* `AbelianVariety.mulBy_trivial`: `[n] = 𝟙 (trivial K)`.

That `End (trivial K)` is the zero ring needs no declaration here: `AbelianVariety.End.instUnique`
turns the uniqueness of homomorphisms into the trivial abelian variety
(`AbelianVariety.uniqueHomToTrivial`) into `Unique (End (trivial K))` by instance search, which the
`example` below records.

This is the specialization of the endomorphism ring to the trivial abelian variety, kept apart from
`End.Basic` so that the generic construction does not depend on the trivial-variety theory. It
advances the same roadmap item, `TauCetiRoadmap/JacobianChallenge/README.md`, Layer E, "`[n]` as an
isogeny". No external mathematics is vendored: both facts come from the uniqueness of homomorphisms
out of the zero object, already proved in
`TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.AbelianVariety.Trivial`.

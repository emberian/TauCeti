# Base change of the endomorphism ring of an abelian variety

Extending the base field along `K → L` sends an endomorphism of an abelian variety `A` over `K`
to an endomorphism of `A.baseChange L`. This assignment is a ring homomorphism
`AbelianVariety.End.baseChange : End A →+* End (A.baseChange L)`: it is additive because base
change respects the pointwise group law on homomorphisms
(`AbelianVariety.Hom.baseChangeMonoidHom`), and multiplicative because it is functorial
(`AbelianVariety.Hom.baseChange_comp`).

* `AbelianVariety.End.baseChange`: the ring homomorphism, with
  `AbelianVariety.End.toHom_baseChange` translating it back into base change of morphisms;
* `AbelianVariety.End.baseChange_congr`: base change commutes with the identification of
  endomorphism rings along an isomorphism of abelian varieties;
* `AbelianVariety.baseChange_mulBy`: multiplication by `n` base changes to multiplication by `n`.

The last statement is the concrete check that the ring homomorphism is the expected one: `[n]` is
the image of the integer `n` in the endomorphism ring, and a ring homomorphism preserves integers,
so `[n]` is intrinsic to the abelian variety and does not depend on the base field. That is also
what a later Layer E statement about `[n]` being an isogeny needs in order to be checked after
base change to an algebraic closure.

This advances `TauCetiRoadmap/JacobianChallenge/README.md`, Layer E, "Abelian variety = smooth,
proper, geometrically connected group scheme over `k`; basic API" and its item "`[n]` as an
isogeny", together with the base-change compatibility required in the roadmap's end goal: the
Jacobian's universal property produces homomorphisms of abelian varieties, and comparing them
after base change is exactly comparing them in the base-changed endomorphism ring.

No external mathematics is vendored. The ring structure is Mathlib's, transported along the
already-established base-change functoriality of abelian-variety homomorphisms.

/-- Extension of the base field along `K → L`, as a ring homomorphism between endomorphism rings.

Addition in an endomorphism ring is the pointwise group law of the abelian variety and
multiplication is composition, so additivity is `AbelianVariety.Hom.baseChange_mul` and
multiplicativity is `AbelianVariety.Hom.baseChange_comp` (composition being taken in the reversed
order in which `AbelianVariety.End` multiplies).

The action is characterized by `AbelianVariety.End.toHom_baseChange` and
`AbelianVariety.End.baseChange_ofHom`, so the implementation is not exposed. -/

/-- Base change commutes with conjugation by an isomorphism of abelian varieties: conjugating and
then extending the base field is the same as extending the base field and conjugating by the
base-changed isomorphism, `CategoryTheory.Functor.mapIso` for `AbelianVariety.baseChangeFunctor`.

`Functor.mapIso` produces an isomorphism `(baseChangeFunctor L).obj A ≅ (baseChangeFunctor L).obj B`
and `AbelianVariety.baseChangeFunctor_obj` identifies its endpoints with the base changes, so the
conjugating isomorphism is the composite of the three; writing it that way keeps the statement
type-correct without unfolding the functor. -/

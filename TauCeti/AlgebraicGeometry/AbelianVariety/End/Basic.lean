# The endomorphism ring of an abelian variety

The endomorphisms of an abelian variety `A` over a field `K` form a ring: addition is the
pointwise group law of `A`, multiplication is composition. This file constructs that ring and the
multiplication-by-`n` endomorphism `[n] : A ⟶ A` as the image of `n : ℤ` in it.

The pointwise group law on homomorphisms of abelian varieties is written *multiplicatively* in
`TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.AbelianVariety.MorphismGroup`, matching the multiplicative encoding
(`GrpObj`, `μ`, `η`, `ι`) of a group object. A ring is written additively, so the endomorphism ring
is the additive reindexing `Additive (A ⟶ A)` of that group rather than the hom-set itself; this
keeps the multiplicative convention on all hom-sets intact. (Declaring `AbelianVariety K`
`CategoryTheory.Preadditive` instead would put an `AddCommGroup (A ⟶ B)` on the very hom-sets that
already carry `AbelianVariety.Hom.instCommGroup` for the same operation — the situation `Additive`
exists to avoid — and would mean re-deriving that group law additively rather than transporting
Mathlib's multiplicative `CategoryTheory.MonObj.Hom.commGroup`; that is a change to already-merged
material, not part of this file.) Reindexing only the additive structure leaves `End A` the same
type as Mathlib's `CategoryTheory.End A`, so the multiplicative monoid here *is* Mathlib's, and
conjugation by an isomorphism is Mathlib's `CategoryTheory.Iso.conj`.
`AbelianVariety.End.toHom` and `AbelianVariety.End.ofHom` translate between the two views, and the
`toHom_*` lemmas turn every ring operation into a group or categorical operation on morphisms.

* `AbelianVariety.End A`: the endomorphism ring, with `AbelianVariety.End.instRing`, and
  `AbelianVariety.End.instUnique` recognizing it as the zero ring when `A` has one endomorphism;
* `AbelianVariety.mulBy A n`: the endomorphism `[n]`, with `AbelianVariety.mulBy_eq_zpow`
  identifying it with the `n`-th power map and `AbelianVariety.mulBy_comp` recording that every
  homomorphism of abelian varieties commutes with it;
* `AbelianVariety.End.congr`: an isomorphism of abelian varieties conjugates one endomorphism ring
  isomorphically onto the other.

The specialization to the trivial abelian variety is in
`TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.AbelianVariety.End.Trivial`, which is where the trivial-variety theory
gets imported.

This advances `TauCetiRoadmap/JacobianChallenge/README.md`, Layer E, "Abelian variety = smooth,
proper, geometrically connected group scheme over `k`; basic API", and its item "`[n]` as an
isogeny" — the endomorphism ring is where `[n]` lives, and where the homomorphism produced by
Layer F's universal property of the Abel–Jacobi map is compared with others. That `[n]` *is* an
isogeny needs the dimension and torsion theory of Layer E and is not proved here. No external
mathematics is vendored; the ring is assembled from Tau Ceti's homomorphism-group API, Mathlib's
`Additive` type synonym, Mathlib's `CategoryTheory.End` monoid and `CategoryTheory.Iso.conj`, with
only the distributivity supplied by `AbelianVariety.Hom.mul_comp` and `AbelianVariety.Hom.comp_mul`
proved here — the same assembly as Mathlib's `Ring (CategoryTheory.End X)` for preadditive
categories.

/-- The endomorphism ring of an abelian variety `A`: the endomorphisms of `A`, with addition the
pointwise group law of `A` and multiplication composition.

Since the pointwise group law on `A ⟶ A` is written multiplicatively (see
`AbelianVariety.Hom.instCommGroup`) while a ring is written additively, this is the additive
reindexing of the group `A ⟶ A`; use `AbelianVariety.End.toHom` and `AbelianVariety.End.ofHom` to
pass between an element of the ring and the endomorphism it denotes. -/

/-! ### The additive group

Addition in `End A` is the pointwise group law of the target, so each additive operation
translates into the corresponding multiplicative one on morphisms. -/

  inferInstanceAs (AddCommGroup (Additive (A ⟶ A)))

@[simp] lemma toHom_sub (x y : End A) : toHom (x - y) = toHom x / toHom y :=
  _root_.toMul_sub x y

/-! The two scalar-multiplication lemmas are deliberately not `@[simp]`, unlike the rest of this
section: `simp` rewrites a scalar multiple in a ring to a product (`nsmul_eq_mul`, `zsmul_eq_mul`),
so their left-hand sides are not in `simp` normal form. Use `AbelianVariety.End.toHom_natCast` or
`AbelianVariety.End.toHom_intCast` together with `AbelianVariety.End.toHom_mul` instead. -/

lemma toHom_zsmul (n : ℤ) (x : End A) : toHom (n • x) = toHom x ^ n :=
  _root_.toMul_zsmul n x

/-! ### The multiplicative monoid

Multiplication in `End A` is composition, in the order of `Function.comp` rather than of
`CategoryTheory.CategoryStruct.comp`. Since `End A` reindexes only the *additive* structure of
`A ⟶ A`, it is the same type as Mathlib's `CategoryTheory.End A`, so the multiplicative monoid is
Mathlib's `CategoryTheory.End.monoid` rather than a new one. -/

@[simp] lemma toHom_mul (x y : End A) : toHom (x * y) = toHom y ≫ toHom x := (rfl)

/-- Composing two endomorphisms is multiplying them in the endomorphism ring, in the reversed
order. -/
lemma ofHom_comp (f g : A ⟶ A) : ofHom (f ≫ g) = ofHom g * ofHom f := (rfl)

/-! ### The ring

Composition of homomorphisms of abelian varieties is bimultiplicative for the pointwise group law
(`AbelianVariety.Hom.mul_comp` and `AbelianVariety.Hom.comp_mul`), which is exactly
distributivity of multiplication over addition in `End A`. -/

This is Mathlib's `Unique (Additive α)` instance; it is stated here, rather than reproved wherever a
hom-set is known to be a singleton, because unfolding `End A` to `Additive (A ⟶ A)` is only possible
in this module. -/

  inferInstanceAs (Unique (Additive (A ⟶ A)))

  rw [hn, toHom_zsmul, toHom_one]

/-! ### Transport along an isomorphism -/

/-- Conjugation by an isomorphism `e : A ≅ B` of abelian varieties, as an isomorphism of
endomorphism rings `End A ≃+* End B`.

The multiplicative part is Mathlib's `CategoryTheory.Iso.conj`; only additivity — that conjugation
respects the pointwise group law — has to be proved here. -/
def congr (e : A ≅ B) : End A ≃+* End B where
  __ := e.conj
  -- Mathlib's `e.conj` lives on `CategoryTheory.End`, of which `End A` is the definitional

  -- bridged by a rewrite lemma, because a statement about `toHom (e.conj x)` for `x : End A` does
  -- not elaborate: the coercion of `e.conj` fixes its argument type to `CategoryTheory.End A`.
  -- So the goal is moved into the morphism view once, definitionally, and `simp` closes it from

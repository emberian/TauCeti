# Pullback of schemes along `Spec.map`

Mathlib's `CategoryTheory.Over.pullbackId` and `CategoryTheory.Over.pullbackComp` compare the
pullback functors on `Over` categories along an identity morphism and along a composite. This
file reads those comparisons through `Spec`: `Spec.map` takes an identity ring map to an
identity morphism of schemes and a composite `f ≫ g` to `Spec.map g ≫ Spec.map f`, so pullback
along `Spec.map (𝟙 R)` is the identity functor on schemes over `Spec R`, and pullback along
`Spec.map (f ≫ g)` is the composite of pullback along `Spec.map f` with pullback along
`Spec.map g`.

Nothing here mentions affineness or group objects: these are statements about arbitrary schemes
over an affine base, and they are the underlying comparisons of the base-change functors on
affine group schemes in `TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/AffineGroupScheme/BaseChange/Basic.lean`.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.Over.pullbackSpecMapId`: pullback along `Spec.map (𝟙 R)` is the
  identity functor.
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.Over.pullbackSpecMapComp`: pullback along `Spec.map (f ≫ g)` is a
  composite of pullbacks.

# Geometrically integral morphisms

Mathlib's `AlgebraicGeometry.GeometricallyIntegral` records that the property is stable under base
change, but has nothing about isomorphisms. This file adds the missing base case:

* `AlgebraicGeometry.geometricallyIntegral_of_isIso`: an isomorphism of schemes is geometrically
  integral.

No external mathematics is vendored; the proof reuses Mathlib's stability of the isomorphism
morphism property under pullback and the integrality of a scheme isomorphic to an integral one.

/-- An isomorphism of schemes is geometrically integral.

Every base change of an isomorphism is an isomorphism, so the fibre product of `f` with a morphism
`Spec L ⟶ Y` is isomorphic to `Spec L`, which is integral because `L` is a field. -/

# Naturality of continuous ambient isotopy for smooth embeddings

The geometric-topology roadmap asks that isotopy and ambient isotopy be defined once, in
generality, and then specialised to smooth embeddings such as geometric knot presentations.
`TauCeti.SmoothEmbedding.ContinuousAmbientIsotopic` is that continuous ambient-isotopy relation
on bundled smooth embeddings. This file records its coordinate-change API.

The statements are formulated for already-constructed bundled smooth embeddings, together with
equalities identifying their underlying continuous maps after precomposition or postcomposition.
This avoids depending on Mathlib's still-axiomatized predicate-level composition theorem for
smooth embeddings, while still giving downstream knot and embedding presentations the relation
transport they need once they have built the relevant embeddings.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.SmoothEmbedding.ContinuousAmbientIsotopic.of_toContinuousMap_eq`: transport the
  relation across equality of underlying continuous maps.
* `TauCeti.SmoothEmbedding.ContinuousAmbientIsotopic.precomp_of_toContinuousMap_eq`: precompose
  both embeddings by a continuous source map, expressed through already-bundled embeddings.
* `TauCeti.SmoothEmbedding.ContinuousAmbientIsotopic.postcomp_homeomorph_of_toContinuousMap_eq`:
  postcompose both embeddings by a homeomorphism of ambient spaces.
* `TauCeti.SmoothEmbedding.ContinuousAmbientIsotopic.`
  `postcomp_homeomorph_precomp_of_toContinuousMap_eq`:
  the combined source and ambient coordinate-change form.

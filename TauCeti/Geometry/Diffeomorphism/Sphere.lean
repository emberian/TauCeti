# The orthogonal group acts on the sphere by diffeomorphisms

A linear isometry equivalence of a real inner product space `E` preserves norms, so it restricts
to a self-map of the unit sphere; this file shows that restriction is a diffeomorphism of the
sphere as an analytic manifold, and assembles the restrictions into a group homomorphism
`(E ≃ₗᵢ[ℝ] E) →* Diff (𝓡 n) (sphere (0 : E) 1) m` into the self-diffeomorphism group of
`TauCeti.Geometry.Diffeomorphism.Group`. Taking `E = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin (n + 1))`, whose
linear isometry group is the orthogonal group `O(n + 1)`, this is the reference inclusion
`O(n + 1) → Diff(Sⁿ)`.

That inclusion is the last item asked for by layer 3 of the geometric-topology roadmap
(`TauCetiRoadmap/GeometricTopology/README.md`, layer 3, "diffeomorphism groups with the C^∞
topology"): "The reference inclusion `O(n+1) → Diff(Sⁿ)` (consume `Matrix.orthogonalGroup`,
layer 7's isometry action, and the sphere instance) as a continuous group homomorphism". The
roadmap wants it *continuous* for the `C^∞` topology on `Diff(Sⁿ)`, and that topology is a
separate layer-3 deliverable which does not exist yet, so this file builds the group
homomorphism and stops there; continuity is a statement to add once the topology lands. It is
also the map whose source and target the Smale conjecture `Diff(S³) ≃ O(4)`
(`[Kir97, Problem 4.34]`, Hatcher) compares, and the roadmap's acceptance criterion "the
inclusion `O(4) → Diff(S³)` is stateable" is `TauCeti.orthogonalToDiffSphere 3 ω`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.LinearIsometryEquiv.unitSphereEquiv`: the self-equivalence of the unit sphere
  obtained by restricting a linear isometry equivalence.
* `TauCeti.LinearIsometryEquiv.unitSphereDiffeomorph`: that restriction as a `C^m`
  diffeomorphism of the unit sphere, viewed as a manifold modelled on `𝓡 n`.
* `TauCeti.LinearIsometryEquiv.unitSphereDiffHom`: the group homomorphism
  `(E ≃ₗᵢ[ℝ] E) →* Diff (𝓡 n) (sphere (0 : E) 1) m`.
* `TauCeti.orthogonalToDiffSphere`: the reference inclusion `O(n + 1) → Diff(Sⁿ)`, the case
  `E = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin (n + 1))` of `unitSphereDiffHom`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.LinearIsometryEquiv.contMDiff_unitSphereEquiv`: the restriction to the unit sphere is
  `C^m` for every smoothness exponent.
* `TauCeti.LinearIsometryEquiv.isometry_unitSphereEquiv`: it is an isometry for the distance the
  sphere inherits from `E`, so the action is by isometries of the round sphere.
* `TauCeti.LinearIsometryEquiv.unitSphereDiffeomorph_neg_apply`: the diffeomorphism induced by
  `-1 ∈ O(n + 1)` is the antipodal map.
* `TauCeti.LinearMap.eq_of_eqOn_unitSphere`: a linear map is
  determined by its values on the unit sphere, whence
  `TauCeti.LinearIsometryEquiv.unitSphereDiffHom_injective` and
  `TauCeti.orthogonalToDiffSphere_injective`: the inclusion is injective, so `O(n + 1)` is
  realised as a subgroup of `Diff(Sⁿ)`.

## Implementation notes

The declarations below and the generic unit-sphere API in
`TauCeti.Geometry.Sphere.LinearIsometry` live in `TauCeti.LinearIsometryEquiv`, mirroring the
Mathlib namespace of the objects they are about, so they are applied in prefix form
(`unitSphereEquiv e`) rather than by dot notation.

# Cycles and boundaries for the fully blocked grid differential

This file packages the kernel and range of the fully blocked grid differential as the cycle
and boundary submodules of the finite free grid chain module. It does not assert the global
square-zero theorem; instead it records the exact condition under which boundaries are cycles.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedCycles`: the kernel of the fully blocked differential.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedBoundaries`: the range of the fully blocked differential.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedCycles_eq_ker`,
  `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedBoundaries_eq_range`: the cycle and boundary submodules
  restated as the kernel and range of the differential.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedBoundaries_le_cycles`: boundaries lie in cycles whenever the
  fully blocked differential squares to zero.

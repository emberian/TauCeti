# Small-grid cycles and boundaries for the fully blocked grid differential

This file computes the cycle and boundary submodules of the fully blocked grid differential in
the already-proved zero-differential small-grid case.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedCycles_eq_top_of_le_two` and
  `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedBoundaries_eq_bot_of_le_two`: the small-grid computation.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.natCard_fullyBlockedCycles_of_le_two` and
  `TauCeti.GridDiagram.natCard_fullyBlockedBoundaries_of_le_two`: the small-grid cardinalities.

compute on explicit small grids.

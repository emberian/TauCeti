# The fully blocked grid differential on grids of size at most two

This file records the first small-grid computation for the fully blocked grid differential.
In an `n × n` grid with `n ≤ 2`, every open cyclic interval in `Fin n` is empty. Consequently
every toroidal rectangle has empty interior, so every oriented rectangle is empty and avoids all
markings. Between two distinct grid states the two oriented rectangles therefore both contribute
to the fully blocked count, and their total is zero in `ZMod 2`; between a state and itself there
are no rectangles. Thus the whole fully blocked differential vanishes.

The cases `n = 0` and `n = 1` already follow from the column-swap support bound. The new content
here is the size-two cancellation, which is the first nontrivial sanity check for the rectangle
count defining the fully blocked grid complex.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedRectangleCount_eq_zero_of_le_two`: every fully blocked
  rectangle coefficient vanishes in grid size at most two.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedDifferential_eq_zero_of_le_two`: the fully blocked
  differential is the zero linear map in grid size at most two.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedDifferential_eq_zero_of_two`: the explicit `2 × 2` form.

## References

This supplies a prerequisite for
`TauCetiRoadmap/CombinatorialHeegaardFloer/README.md`, Lane G.3, "The complexes and `∂² = 0`",
and for the standing convention that the grid complexes compute on explicit small grids. The
rectangle-count convention follows Ozsváth--Stipsicz--Szabó, *Grid Homology for Knots and
Links*, Chapter 3.

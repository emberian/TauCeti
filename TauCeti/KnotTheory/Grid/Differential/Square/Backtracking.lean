# Backtracking in the two-step grid differential support

The support of the square of the fully blocked grid differential is already bounded by
`GridState.twoStepColumnSwapNeighbors`: states reached from `x` by two nontrivial column
transpositions. This file records the first exact feature of that two-step support. A path that
swaps the same pair of columns twice returns to the starting state, so the source state appears in
its own two-step neighbour set exactly when the grid has at least two columns.

This is small but useful bookkeeping for the later `∂² = 0` rectangle-pairing argument: diagonal
targets lie in the two-step search space exactly through such backtracking when `2 ≤ n`. Grids of
size `0` and `1` have no two-step targets at all, so any coefficient-level vanishing there follows
from the existing small-grid differential support API rather than from a cancellation argument in
this file.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridState.self_mem_twoStepColumnSwapNeighbors_of_ne`: swapping a pair of distinct
  columns and then swapping it back puts `x` in its own two-step neighbour set.
* `TauCeti.GridState.sym2_mk_eq_of_swapColumns_swapColumns_eq_self`: any diagonal two-step
  witness swaps the same unordered pair of columns twice.
* `TauCeti.GridState.self_mem_twoStepColumnSwapNeighbors_iff_exists_pair_ne`: this is possible
  exactly when there is a distinct pair of columns.
* `TauCeti.GridState.self_mem_twoStepColumnSwapNeighbors_iff_two_le`: equivalently, exactly when
  `2 ≤ n`.

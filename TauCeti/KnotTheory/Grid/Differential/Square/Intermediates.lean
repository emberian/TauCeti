# Intermediate states in two column swaps

The support of the square of the fully blocked grid differential is contained in the states
reached from `x` by two nontrivial column swaps. This file records the exact finite set of possible
intermediate states between a source `x` and a target `z`: the intersection of their one-swap
neighbour sets.

For a diagonal path `x → y → x`, this set is exactly the full one-swap neighbour set of
`x`. For a nondiagonal path, conjugating the first transposition by the second gives another
factorization through a distinct intermediate state. Consequently every nonempty nondiagonal
intermediate set has at least two elements.

These state-level factorizations do not yet pair rectangles: a later juxtaposition argument must
also track which of the two rectangles with given corners is used and whether its domain avoids
the markings. They provide the finite diagonal/nondiagonal case split on which that argument is
built.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GridState.twoStepColumnSwapIntermediates`: the possible middle states in a two-swap
  path from `x` to `z`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridState.nonempty_twoStepColumnSwapIntermediates_iff`: the intermediate set is
  nonempty exactly for a two-step neighbour.
* `TauCeti.GridState.twoStepColumnSwapIntermediates_self`: the intermediates between `x` and
  itself are exactly its one-swap neighbours.
* `TauCeti.GridState.one_lt_card_twoStepColumnSwapIntermediates`: a nondiagonal two-step
  path has at least two possible intermediate states.

# Two-step support for the fully blocked grid differential

This file records the finite support bookkeeping for applying the fully blocked grid
differential twice. The one-step support theorem says that `∂ x` is supported on the states
obtained from `x` by one nontrivial column transposition. Applying that theorem again gives a
small ambient set for `∂ (∂ x)`: the union of the column-swap neighbours of those neighbours.

The actual `∂² = 0` proof is not asserted here. These lemmas only isolate the finite target set
on which the later rectangle-pairing argument has to check cancellation.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridState.twoStepColumnSwapNeighbors`: the states reachable from `x` by two
  nontrivial column transpositions.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedDifferential_sq_single_support_subset`: the support of
  `∂ (∂ x)` lies in that two-step neighbour set.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedDifferential_sq_support_subset_biUnion`: the corresponding
  support bound for an arbitrary finitely supported chain.

# The grid `J`-function as a neighbor count

The ordered southwest count `GridPoint.I s t` and the symmetrized `J`-function are defined in
`JFunction.lean` as cardinalities of a filtered product of point sets. This file records their
fiberwise reading: `I s t` is the sum over the left points of the number of right points strictly
northeast of them, and dually over the right points. Specializing the left (or right) argument to
a singleton turns each `J`-pairing against a single grid square into a plain count of the strictly
comparable points of the other set.

The singleton pairings are exactly the corner terms `GridPoint.J {corner} P` produced by the
rectangle grading-change localizations (`GradingChange.lean`), where the four corners of a
rectangle move are paired against the `O`- and `X`-marking sets. Reading each such term as the
number of markings strictly northeast or southwest of the corner is the counting form those
localizations feed into.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridPoint.I_eq_sum_card_filter`, `TauCeti.GridPoint.I_eq_sum_card_filter_right`: the
  ordered southwest count as a sum of fiber counts over the left (resp. right) point set.
* `TauCeti.GridPoint.I_singleton_left`, `TauCeti.GridPoint.I_singleton_right`: the ordered
  southwest count against a single grid square, as the number of strictly northeast (resp.
  southwest) points of the other set.
* `TauCeti.GridPoint.JNum_singleton_left`,
  `TauCeti.GridPoint.JNum_singleton_left_eq_card`: the symmetrized numerator against a single
  square, as the two directed counts and as the single count of strictly comparable points.
* `TauCeti.GridPoint.J_singleton_left`, `TauCeti.GridPoint.two_mul_J_singleton_left`: the
  `J`-pairing against a single square is half the number of strictly comparable points, so twice
  it is that integer count.

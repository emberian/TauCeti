# Rectangles in grid diagrams

This file adds the first rectangle API for the grid-combinatorial lane of the Heegaard Floer
roadmap. The grid lives on a torus, so the basic one-dimensional ingredient is the open-open
circular interval in `Fin n`. A grid rectangle is then the product of two such intervals,
recorded as the finite set of squares in its interior.

The final section packages an oriented rectangle from one grid state to another: two columns
where the states exchange rows, and agreement everywhere else. This is the shape counted by
the grid differential; the `IsEmptyFor` and `AvoidsMarkings` predicates record the two
finite-set disjointness conditions used for empty rectangles and marking-avoiding rectangles.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GridRectangle`: a toroidal rectangle, represented by its four cyclic sides.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangle.symm`: the opposite toroidal rectangle with side columns reversed.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangle.transpose`: the diagonal reflection of a toroidal rectangle, exchanging
  the column and row sides.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangle.rotate`: the half-turn rotation of a toroidal rectangle, reversing both
  coordinates.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangle.interior`: the finite set of squares strictly inside the rectangle.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween`: an oriented rectangle from one grid state to another.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.symm`: the opposite oriented rectangle from `y` to `x`.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.swapSides`: the complementary oriented rectangle from `x` to `y`
  with its two side columns exchanged.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.transpose`: the diagonal reflection of an oriented rectangle, from
  `x.transpose` to `y.transpose`.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.transposeEquiv`: the diagonal reflection packaged as an involutive
  equivalence with oriented rectangles from `x.transpose` to `y.transpose`.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.rotate`: the half-turn rotation of an oriented rectangle, from
  `x.rotate` to `y.rotate`.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.rotateEquiv`: the half-turn rotation packaged as an equivalence
  with oriented rectangles from `x.rotate` to `y.rotate`.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.all`: all oriented rectangles from `x` to `y`.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.emptyRectangles`: the empty rectangles from `x` to `y`.

## References

This supplies a prerequisite for the Tau Ceti Heegaard Floer roadmap,
`HeegaardFloer/README.md` in TauCetiRoadmap. Lane G.1, "Grid diagrams and grid states",
asks for rectangles and empty rectangles `Rect°(x, y)`, and Lane G.3, "The complexes and
`∂² = 0`", uses the opposite-rectangle bookkeeping in the rectangle-pairing arguments. The
encoding follows the toroidal grid-diagram convention from Ozsváth--Stipsicz--Szabó, *Grid
Homology for Knots and Links*, Chapter 3.

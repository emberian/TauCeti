# A two-rectangle bound for oriented rectangles between grid states

An oriented rectangle `R : GridRectangleBetween x y` is determined by its two side columns
`R.left`, `R.right`: away from those columns the two states agree, and at those columns they
exchange rows (`RectangleSwap.lean`). This file pins down the uniform two-rectangle upper bound
between two fixed grid states, and the exact count once one such rectangle exists.

The key observation is purely about the side columns. A column `c` is a side column of `R`
exactly when the two states differ there: if `c` is neither `R.left` nor `R.right` then
`y c = x c`, and at a side column the states genuinely disagree because the source permutation
is injective. So the *unordered* pair of side columns is forced — it is the set of columns where
`x` and `y` differ — and a rectangle between `x` and `y` is determined up to the *order* of its
two side columns. Reversing the two side columns gives the other oriented rectangle
(`swapSides`), so there are at most two oriented rectangles, and exactly two whenever at least one
exists. The separate `RectangleSwap.lean` file records the transposition/existence criterion.

This is the finiteness backbone of the grid differential: the coefficient of `y` in the fully
blocked differential of `x` counts a sub-collection of these at-most-two rectangles, so the
differential of a generator is supported on the column-transposition neighbours of that
generator.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.apply_ne_iff`: a column is a side column exactly when the two
  states differ there.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.eq_or_eq_swapSides`: any two oriented rectangles between the same
  states are equal or differ by `swapSides`.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.all_eq_pair`, `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.card_all_le_two`,
  `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.card_all_eq_two_of_nonempty`: there are at most two oriented
  rectangles between two states, and exactly two when there is at least one.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.card_emptyRectangles_le_two`: there are at most two empty
  rectangles between two states.

## References

This supplies a prerequisite for `TauCetiRoadmap/CombinatorialHeegaardFloer/README.md`, Lane G.3,
"The complexes and `∂² = 0`": the count of rectangles between two states is the finiteness fact
underlying the differential. The statement that exactly two rectangles connect two states
differing by a transposition follows Ozsváth--Stipsicz--Szabó, *Grid Homology for Knots and
Links*, Chapter 4.

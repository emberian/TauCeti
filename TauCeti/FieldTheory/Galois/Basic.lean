# The Galois theory of separable quadratic extensions

Material complementing `Mathlib/FieldTheory/Galois/Basic.lean` for a separable quadratic
extension `L/K`: it has exactly two automorphisms, so the identity and any one nontrivial
automorphism exhaust `Gal(L/K)`, and an element fixed by a nontrivial automorphism lies in the
base field. `Algebra.IsQuadraticExtension.quadraticCharacter` records the resulting
`Gal(L/K) →* ℤˣ` — the identity to `1`, the nontrivial automorphism to `-1`. It is there so that
a quantity alternating with the Galois action can be described uniformly in `σ` rather than by
cases; `WeierstrassCurve.quadraticTwistPointEquiv_map_eq_quadraticCharacter_smul_map` is the
intended consumer. Mathlib's `quadraticChar` is a different object — the Legendre symbol of a
finite field, not a character of a Galois group.

The file closes with one lemma that is **not** about quadratic extensions:
`AlgEquiv.restrictNormal_eq_one_iff_algebraMap` says that in a tower `K ⊆ L ⊆ M` with `L/K`
normal, an automorphism of `M` restricts to the identity on `L` exactly when it fixes `L`
pointwise. Mathlib states this for an `IntermediateField`
(`AlgEquiv.restrictNormal_eq_one_iff`) while `AlgEquiv.restrictNormal` itself is already given for
an abstract algebra, so only the characterisation needed transporting; it is a bridge to Mathlib
rather than ported material, and it asks for `[Normal K L]` alone.

Mathlib already supplies the surrounding structure: `Algebra.IsQuadraticExtension` makes `L/K`
finite and normal (`Algebra.IsQuadraticExtension.normal`), hence Galois with separability
(`Algebra.IsQuadraticExtension.isGalois`); `IsGalois.card_aut_eq_finrank` counts the
automorphisms and `IsGalois.mem_range_algebraMap_iff_fixed` characterises the base field.

These are the descent inputs for the quadratic-twist layer of
`TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md` (§Layer 5), consumed by
`TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/GaloisDescent.lean` and by
`TauCeti/RingTheory/Norm/Quadratic.lean`, which expresses the trace and norm of a
separable quadratic extension through its nontrivial automorphism.

/-- **The quadratic character of a separable quadratic extension**: the identity goes to `1` and
the nontrivial automorphism to `-1`. `Gal(L/K)` has order two, so this is a group isomorphism onto
`ℤˣ`, but the point of packaging it as a `MonoidHom` is that a statement which alternates in `σ` —
a Galois action twisted by the extension, as for the points of a quadratic twist — can then be
written uniformly in `σ` instead of split into a fixed and a moved branch by every consumer. -/

# Rescaling generators by the base field

Multiplying each generator of an intermediate field by a nonzero scalar from the base field does
not change the field it generates: the base scalars and their inverses are already there. This is
the field-theoretic content of "generators matter only up to their square class" arguments, where
a generator `√(a c²)` is replaced by `√a = c⁻¹ · √(a c²)`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IntermediateField.adjoin_range_algebraMap_mul`: for nonzero `u : ι → K`,
  `K(u i · x i : i) = K(x i : i)`.

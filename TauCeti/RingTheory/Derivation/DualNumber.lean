# Dual-number points and derivations

An `R`-algebra homomorphism `A →ₐ[R] B[ε]` into the dual numbers lifting a fixed point
`A →ₐ[R] B` is the same data as an `R`-derivation of `A` valued in `B`. This is the
infinitesimal-lifting dictionary specialised to the square-zero extension `B[ε] → B`,
and it is the engine identifying the tangent space of a functor of points with a module
of derivations (reductive-groups roadmap, Layer 2): tangent vectors at a point are
exactly the dual-number points lying over it.

The fixed point is carried by the algebra-tower hypotheses `[Algebra A B]`
`[IsScalarTower R A B]`, as in `Mathlib.RingTheory.Derivation.ToSquareZero`. For an
arbitrary point `φ : A →ₐ[R] B`, instantiate the tower locally with
`letI := φ.toRingHom.toAlgebra` and `IsScalarTower.of_algHom φ` — in a fresh scope
only: installing the instance where an `SMul A B` already exists creates a diamond,
and derivations elaborated before it refer to the old point.

The construction is direct (send `d` to `a ↦ inl (algebraMap A B a) + inr (d a)`),
which keeps `B` an arbitrary semiring — the image of `A` is central by
`Algebra.commutes` — where the ideal-general route through
`Mathlib.RingTheory.Derivation.ToSquareZero` would force a `CommRing`.

## Main declarations

* `derivationToDualNumberEquivLift`: `R`-derivations `A → B` are equivalent to lifts
  `A →ₐ[R] B[ε]` of the structure point along `TrivSqZeroExt.fstHom`.

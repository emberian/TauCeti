# Maps out of the completion of a localisation

A continuous ring homomorphism out of the completion of a localisation `S` of `A` is determined by
its restriction to `A`. This factors into two independent steps:

* agreeing on `S` forces agreement on `Ŝ`, because `S` is dense in it — that half is about
  completions alone and lives in `TauCeti.Topology.Algebra.UniformRing` as
  `UniformSpace.Completion.ringHom_ext_of_continuous`;
* agreeing after `algebraMap A S` forces agreement on `S`, by `IsLocalization.ringHom_ext`.

Only continuity is required of the two maps, and the target need only be a semiring carrying a
Hausdorff topology — no compatibility between the topology and the ring operations is used, and
nothing is asked of the submonoid.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.completion_localization_ringHom_ext_of_continuous`: two continuous ring homomorphisms
  out of `Ŝ` agreeing on `A` are equal.

## References

* [Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces*][wedhorn_adic], §8, where this is the reason a map out of `A⟨T/s⟩` is
  pinned down by its restriction to `A`.

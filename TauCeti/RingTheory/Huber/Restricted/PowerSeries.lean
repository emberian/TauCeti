# Restricted Power Series

This file defines restricted power series `A⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩`, following Wedhorn's *Adic Spaces*,
where the convergent/restricted power series ring is (5.6.1) in §5.6.

## Main definitions

* `IsRestricted`: A power series is **restricted** if its coefficients
  converge to `0` along the cofinite filter on multi-indices. The coefficients are asked only for
  a `0` and a topology, so the same predicate serves ring and module coefficients.
* `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubring k A`: The subring of restricted power series in `k`
  variables over `A`, denoted `A⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩`.
* `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmodule k A M`: the `A`-submodule of restricted power series with
  coefficients in a topological `A`-module `M`, denoted `M⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩`. This is the object
  Wedhorn's Remark 8.29 compares with `M ⊗[A] A⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩`. It *is* Mathlib's
  `Filter.zeroAtFilterSubmodule` at the cofinite filter, under the Huber-theoretic name.
* `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubringVal`: the inclusion `A⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩ → MvPowerSeries (Fin k) A` as
  an `A`-algebra map. `A⟨T⟩` is a `Subring` carrying an `Algebra A` instance rather than a
  `Subalgebra`, so `Subalgebra.val` does not apply.
* `isRestricted_of_hasFiniteSupport`: the introduction rule at module coefficients — finitely many
  nonzero coefficients suffice.
* `isRestricted_pi_iff`: restrictedness of a series with coefficients in a product is
  componentwise.

## Provenance

This module is a port of AINTLIB's `projects/AdicSpaces/Adic spaces/RestrictedPowerSeries.lean`,
the roadmap's designated prior formalisation of this material. Three groups, because the port and
this PR did different things to different declarations.

**AINTLIB's in definition, statement and proof.** `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubring`,
`restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubring.instAlgebra`, `IsRestricted.finite_coeff_notMem`, the private
helpers `finite_shift_bad_set` and `coeff_mul_mem_of_forall_mem`, and `IsRestricted.mul` — the
convolution argument this file exists for. That convolution argument is AINTLIB's; what differs
here is three call sites renamed to `isRestricted_iff_coeff`, and the choice of absorbing
neighbourhood, which now comes from Mathlib's `exists_mem_nhds_zero_mul_subset` on the left and
`TauCeti.Huber.isBounded_finite` on the right, in place of AINTLIB's inline `Aᵐᵒᵖ` transport.

**AINTLIB's in statement, with proofs rewritten here.** Five: `isRestricted_zero`,
`IsRestricted.add` and `IsRestricted.neg`, which now delegate to Mathlib's `Filter.ZeroAtFilter`
API instead of reproving convergence; and `isRestricted_one` and `isRestricted_algebraMap`, which
were near-identical `tendsto_nhds`/`mem_cofinite` arguments and are now special cases of
`isRestricted_of_hasFiniteSupport`. `IsRestricted` itself is AINTLIB's statement at weaker
coefficient binders — `[Zero]` and a topology, where the original asked for a semiring.

**Original here.** `isRestricted_monomial`, `isRestricted_of_hasFiniteSupport`,
`IsRestricted.smul`, `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmodule`, `mem_restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmodule`
and `isRestricted_pi_iff`. The last has no AINTLIB counterpart: the source states restrictedness
only for a single coefficient module, and never for a product. Its content is Mathlib's
`tendsto_pi_nhds`, so what is original here is the statement, not the argument.

The name `isRestricted_iff` needs care: the port introduced it for the `coeff`-form unfolding
lemma, which is now `isRestricted_iff_coeff`. The statement the name carries here — unfolding
through `Filter.ZeroAtFilter` at coefficients asking only for a `0` and a topology — is new.

That originality claim was checked against **both** AINTLIB sources the roadmap designates for
this material, not only `RestrictedPowerSeries.lean`. AINTLIB's `TateAlgebra.lean`,
`TateAlgebraTopology.lean` and `TateAlgebraWedhorn.lean` build `TateAlgebra A` for a *ring* `A`
(`[CommRing A] [TopologicalSpace A] [NonarchimedeanRing A]`) throughout; their `Submodule`
occurrences are ideals of that ring viewed as submodules, not coefficients in a module. There is
no `M⟨X⟩` there, and §0.5's "restricted series with coefficients in a complete topological module"
has no AINTLIB counterpart to credit.

The port additionally moves the declarations into the `TauCeti.Huber` namespace, opts into the
Lean module system with the definition bodies unexposed — hence the added `isRestricted_iff_coeff`,
`mem_restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubring` and `coe_algebraMap_restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubring` — tracks
the Mathlib rename of `Set.mem_setOf_eq` to
`Set.mem_ofPred_eq`, renames the predicate from AINTLIB's `IsRestrictedAdic` (nothing here is
adic), and drops hypotheses that the individual proofs never used.

This is *not* Mathlib's `MvPowerSeries.IsRestricted`, which is stated over a normed ring and
relative to a polyradius `c : σ → ℝ`, asking that `‖coeff t f‖ * ∏ i, c i ^ t i` tend to `0` along
the cofinite filter. The two conditions agree over a normed ring at `c = 1`, but neither is more
general: Mathlib's varies the radius, while `IsRestricted` here needs no norm — indeed no
multiplication, asking the coefficients for nothing beyond a `0` and a topology. It is the
norm-free form that Huber theory requires: Huber ring topologies are defined using an ideal of
definition and need not be induced by a norm. The nonarchimedean hypothesis enters only for
closure under multiplication, and hence for the subring but not for the submodule.

## Implementation notes

The restricted power series ring is defined as a subring of `MvPowerSeries (Fin k) A`
(the formal power series ring), cut out by the condition that coefficients tend to `0`.
This is the canonical concrete definition. `M⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩` is cut out of
`MvPowerSeries (Fin k) M` by the same condition, as an `A`-submodule.

**`IsRestricted` is Mathlib's `Filter.ZeroAtFilter` at the cofinite filter**, applied to the
coefficient function — see `isRestricted_iff`, which is `Iff.rfl`. The closure
lemmas delegate to `zero_zeroAtFilter` and `ZeroAtFilter.add`/`.neg`/`.smul`, and
`restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmodule` *is* `Filter.zeroAtFilterSubmodule` at that filter rather than
a reconstruction of it. The Huber-specific names are kept because `M⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩` is the object the
roadmap names, but no closure property is proved here that Mathlib already has.

`isRestricted_iff` unfolds the predicate through `Filter.ZeroAtFilter`, which is the form the
delegations use and what module coefficients admit; `isRestricted_iff_coeff` unfolds it through
`MvPowerSeries.coeff`, the accessor to prefer wherever the coefficients form a semiring. The two
agree definitionally, because `coeff` is projection.

`isRestricted_of_hasFiniteSupport` delegates separately, through `tendsto_cofinite_pure_iff`, and
`isRestricted_one` and `isRestricted_algebraMap` are its special cases at `1` and at a constant.

The closure of the restricted power series under multiplication (convolution) requires
that `A` is a topological ring. The proof that the convolution of two sequences tending
to `0` also tends to `0` uses the nonarchimedean property to ensure that
arbitrary finite sums of elements in an open additive subgroup remain in the subgroup.

/-! ### Restricted power series -/

/-- An element `f` of the multivariate power series ring `M⦃X₁, …, Xₖ⦄` is **restricted**
if its coefficients converge to `0` along the cofinite filter on multi-indices. That is,
for every open neighborhood `U` of `0` in `M`, all but finitely many coefficients of `f`
lie in `U`. This is the defining property of elements of `M⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩`, and of
`A⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩` in the case of ring coefficients.

The coefficients need carry no algebraic structure beyond a distinguished `0`: the condition is
about a family of points converging in `M`. Stronger binders appear below wherever the *statement*
names an operation, because that is where Mathlib's `MvPowerSeries` instances put the floor —
`f + g` needs `[AddMonoid M]` and `c • f` needs `[Module R M]` for the expression to be
well-formed at all, not because the convergence argument needs them. The module coefficients used
for `M⟨X⟩` are not a semiring, which is why the predicate itself must not ask for one.

See Wedhorn, (5.6.1) and §6.7. -/

/-- A series with coefficients in a product is restricted exactly when each of its components

so the criterion holds for an arbitrary product.

The two sides are **equivalent, not identical** — unlike `isRestricted_iff_coeff` and
`mem_restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmodule`, whose `(Iff.rfl)` proofs mark a genuine defeq, this one
is not a definitional unfolding.

Deliberately **not** `@[simp]`: the right-hand side is a componentwise form that no other lemma in
this file can match, so tagging it would rewrite `IsRestricted` goals at product coefficients into
a shape `isRestricted_zero`, `isRestricted_one` and `isRestricted_monomial` no longer close. -/

/-! ### Module coefficients -/

/-- `M⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩`: the restricted power series with coefficients in a topological `A`-module `M`,
as an `A`-submodule of `M⦃T₁, …, Tₖ⦄`.

This is the module-coefficient counterpart of `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubring`, and it is what
Wedhorn's Remark 8.29 compares with `M ⊗[A] A⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩`. No multiplication is involved, so `M`
needs no ring structure and the nonarchimedean hypothesis that `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubring`
carries is absent here: closure under the scalar action follows from continuity of each
`a • ·` alone. -/

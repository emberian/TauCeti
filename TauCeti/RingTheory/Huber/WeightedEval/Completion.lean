# The universal property of the completed algebra of `A⟨X⟩_T`

Wedhorn's Proposition 5.50 —
`existsUnique_continuous_ringHom_weightedRestrictedSubring_of_isWeightedVarPowerBounded` — is the
universal property of the restricted-series ring `A⟨X⟩_T` itself. This file carries it across the
separated completion: a ring homomorphism `φ : A →+* B` into a complete Hausdorff nonarchimedean
ring, continuous at zero, together with weight-bounded values `bᵢ`, extends to the completion of
`A⟨X⟩_T` in exactly one continuous way.

Neither half is new mathematics; both compose 5.50 with a standard property of the completion.
Existence is `UniformSpace.Completion.extensionHom` applied to the evaluation homomorphism, which
is available exactly because the target is already assumed complete and Hausdorff — the same
hypotheses 5.50 carries, so the completed statement asks for nothing extra. Uniqueness is
`completion_weightedRestrictedSubring_ringHom_ext_of_continuous`, itself
`UniformSpace.Completion.ringHom_ext_of_continuous` — two continuous ring homomorphisms out of a
completion that agree after composing with the coercion are equal — applied to 5.50's own
uniqueness clause for the restrictions along
`UniformSpace.Completion.coeRingHom`.

At the trivial weight family `Tᵢ = {1}` the domain is the completed restricted power-series
algebra `TauCeti.Huber.restrictedMvPowerSeriesCompletion k A`, which the roadmap writes
`A⟨X₁,…,Xₖ⟩` for an arbitrary Tate ring, so this is that algebra's universal property. It is
stated for a general weight family because nothing in the argument uses triviality.

## Main definitions

* `weightedEvalHomCompletion`: the evaluation homomorphism of 5.50, extended to the completion.

## Main results

* `existsUnique_continuous_ringHom_completion_weightedRestrictedSubring`: the `∃!` that the phrase
  "universal property" names, under `IsWeightBounded`.
* existsUnique_continuous_ringHom_completion_weightedRestrictedSubring_of_isWeightedVarPowerBounded
  — the same under `IsWeightedVarPowerBounded`, the coordinatewise condition Proposition 5.50
  states. This is the one to cite as 5.50.
* `completion_weightedRestrictedSubring_ringHom_ext_of_continuous`: the uniqueness half on its own,
  which asks of the target only a semiring structure and a Hausdorff topology.
* `weightedEvalHomCompletion_coe`: the value of the extension on the image of `A⟨X⟩_T`. The body of
  the definition is not exported, so this is how a consumer computes with it.
* `continuous_weightedEvalHomCompletion`: the extension is continuous.

/-! ### Uniqueness

Uniqueness asks far less of the target than existence does, so it is proved first, under its own
hypotheses on `B`. -/

/-- **A continuous homomorphism out of the completion of `A⟨X⟩_T` is determined by its values on
the generators.** Two of them agreeing on every constant series *and* every variable are equal.

This is `weightedRestrictedSubring_ringHom_ext_of_continuous` carried across the completion: that
lemma identifies the two restrictions along `UniformSpace.Completion.coeRingHom`, and
`UniformSpace.Completion.ringHom_ext_of_continuous` propagates the agreement to the completion
by density of the image of the coercion. The completeness and `T3Space` hypotheses that the
universal property below carries are what the evaluation homomorphism needs in order to exist;
uniqueness needs neither. -/

/-- **The universal property of the completion of `A⟨X⟩_T`, under `IsWeightBounded`.** Given
`φ : A →+* B` continuous at zero and weight-bounded values `b`, there is exactly one continuous
ring homomorphism from the completion of `A⟨X⟩_T` to `B` restricting to `φ` on the constants and
sending each `Xᵢ` to `bᵢ`.

This mirrors `existsUnique_continuous_ringHom_weightedRestrictedSubring`, the uncompleted
statement under the same uniform hypothesis. Proposition 5.50's own hypothesis is the
coordinatewise one, so the theorem to cite as 5.50 is the `_of_isWeightedVarPowerBounded` form of
this one, below:
`existsUnique_continuous_ringHom_completion_weightedRestrictedSubring_of_isWeightedVarPowerBounded`.

As in the uncompleted statement, uniqueness is among *continuous* homomorphisms, and continuity is
used at both steps of the argument: 5.50 pins `ψ` down on the image of `A⟨X⟩_T` from its values on
the constants and the variables, by density of the polynomials, and the density of that image in
the completion carries the agreement the rest of the way. Whether a discontinuous homomorphism
with the same values can exist is not addressed here. -/

`isWeightBounded_of_isWeightedVarPowerBounded`, exactly as

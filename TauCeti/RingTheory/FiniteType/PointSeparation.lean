# Separation by algebraically closed points

Let `A` be a commutative algebra of finite type over a field `k`, and let `K` be an
algebraically closed extension of `k`. An element of `A` vanishes under every `k`-algebra
homomorphism `A →ₐ[k] K` exactly when it is nilpotent. In particular, when `A` is reduced,
its `K`-valued points separate elements of `A`.

The proof is the weak Nullstellensatz in intrinsic form. A finite-type algebra over a field is a
Jacobson ring, so a non-nilpotent element is avoided by some maximal ideal. The residue field at
that ideal is finite over `k` by Zariski's lemma and therefore embeds into `K`.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.exists_algHom_apply_ne_zero_of_notMem_radical`: an element outside the radical of an
  ideal is nonzero at some algebraically closed point annihilating the ideal.
* `TauCeti.mem_radical_iff_forall_algHom_apply_eq_zero`: the intrinsic affine
  Nullstellensatz for finite-type algebras.
* `TauCeti.exists_algHom_apply_ne_zero_of_not_isNilpotent`: a non-nilpotent element is nonzero at
  some algebraically closed point.
* `TauCeti.forall_algHom_apply_eq_zero_iff_isNilpotent`: the common kernel of all algebraically
  closed points is the nilradical.
* `TauCeti.eq_one_of_isIdempotentElem_of_forall_algHom_apply_eq_one`: an idempotent evaluating to
  one at every algebraically closed point is one.
* `TauCeti.exists_algHom_apply_ne_of_ne`: points of a reduced finite-type algebra distinguish
  distinct elements.
* `TauCeti.eq_of_forall_algHom_apply_eq`: the corresponding point-separation principle.

This is the reduced finite-type point-separation prerequisite for Layer 5, "Unipotent groups",
of `TauCetiRoadmap/ReductiveGroups/README.md`. It turns pointwise identities over an algebraic
closure into identities in a smooth affine group's coordinate algebra.

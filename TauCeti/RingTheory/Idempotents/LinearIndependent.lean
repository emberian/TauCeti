# Orthogonal nonzero idempotents are linearly independent

Let `k` be a commutative ring whose multiplication cancels (`IsCancelMulZero`, so in particular any
integral domain), let `A` be a torsion-free `k`-algebra -- no nonzero scalar annihilates a nonzero
element -- and let `e : ι → A` be a family of pairwise orthogonal idempotents, none of them zero.
Then the `eᵢ` are linearly independent over `k`: multiplying a vanishing combination
`∑ᵢ gᵢ • eᵢ = 0` by `e_j` kills every term but the `j`-th, which orthogonality and idempotence
leave as `g_j • e_j = 0`.

Mathlib has orthogonal families of idempotents (`OrthogonalIdempotents`, in
`Mathlib/RingTheory/Idempotents.lean`) and the ring-theoretic decompositions they generate, but
records nothing about their linear independence, which is what makes a complete orthogonal family
of the right size a *basis*.

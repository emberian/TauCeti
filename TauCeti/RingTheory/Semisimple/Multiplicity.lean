# The multiplicity of a simple module, as the dimension of a hom space

Let `A` be an algebra over an algebraically closed field `k` and let `S` be a simple `A`-module,
finite-dimensional over `k`.  If a module `M` is written as a finite direct sum of simple
modules, the number of summands isomorphic to `S` is the **multiplicity** of `S` in `M`.  Written
that way the multiplicity refers to a chosen decomposition; this file identifies it with the
manifestly choice-free number

`Module.finrank k (S →ₗ[A] M)`,

so that the multiplicity is an invariant of `M` and needs no decomposition to be defined.

The proof is Schur's lemma plus additivity.  A hom space out of `S` into a finite product splits
as the product of the hom spaces into the factors, and each factor contributes `1` or `0`
according as it is or is not isomorphic to `S`.  Those two values are the dimension forms of
Schur's lemma, `TauCeti.finrank_linearMap_eq_one_of_nonempty_linearEquiv` and
`TauCeti.finrank_linearMap_eq_zero_of_isEmpty_linearEquiv`, proved in
`TauCeti/RingTheory/Semisimple/Schur.lean` alongside the transport of a hom space along an
isomorphism of its target, `TauCeti.homCongrRight`.

Everything is stated for a `k`-algebra `A` and `A`-modules that are `k`-modules compatibly, which
is the generality the group-representation application needs: for `A = k[G]` the hom space is the
space of intertwiners and the theorem is the classical "multiplicity equals the dimension of the
space of intertwiners".

## Main results

* `TauCeti.finrank_linearMap_eq_natCard_of_linearEquiv_pi`: **the multiplicity theorem.**  If
  `M ≃ₗ[A] ∀ i, N i` with every `N i` simple, then `finrank k (S →ₗ[A] M)` is the number of
  indices `i` with `N i ≅ S`.
* `TauCeti.natCard_eq_natCard_of_linearEquiv_pi`: consequently equivalent finite products of
  simple modules have the same number of factors isomorphic to `S`; applied to two decompositions
  of one module, this says that the multiplicity is well defined.
* `TauCeti.finrank_linearMap_pos_iff_exists_nonempty_linearEquiv`: the multiplicity is positive
  exactly when `S` occurs among the factors, so the hom space detects the constituents.
* `TauCeti.finrank_linearMap_eq_natCard_of_linearEquiv_pi_const`: the isotypic case, where `M` is
  a power of `S` itself and the multiplicity is the number of copies.

## Implementation notes

The index set of a decomposition is counted with `Nat.card` of a subtype rather than with a
`Finset.filter`, so that no `DecidablePred` instance enters the statements; the proofs introduce
classical decidability and a `Fintype` structure locally.

Simplicity of `S` and finite dimensionality of `S` over `k` are standing hypotheses, but nothing
is assumed about `M`: the multiplicity theorem takes the decomposition of `M` as data, and the
existence of a decomposition is the separate semisimplicity input.

## References

This builds the multiplicity half of the isotypic-decomposition API that Layer 5 of
`TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/InductionRestriction/README.md` lists as a prerequisite of
Clifford theory: "its **isotypic components** and their **multiplicities**, with multiplicity
equal to `finrank` of the relevant `Hom` space".  It is also the counted form of the isotypic
decomposition asked for in Layer 1 of
`TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/SemisimpleAlgebras/README.md`.

`N i`, then the dimension of the space of `A`-linear maps from a simple module `S` into `M` is
the number of factors isomorphic to `S`.

Only the right-hand side mentions the decomposition, so this is the statement that the
multiplicity of `S` in `M` is an invariant of `M`; see

/-- **The multiplicity is well defined.**  Equivalent finite products of simple modules have the
same number of factors isomorphic to a given simple module.

For two decompositions `e : M ≃ₗ[A] ∀ i, N i` and `f : M ≃ₗ[A] ∀ j, P j` of one module, apply
this to `e.symm.trans f` to see that the multiplicity of `S` in `M` does not depend on the
decomposition.

This is the Jordan-Hölder invariance of the multiplicity, obtained from the multiplicity theorem
rather than from a refinement argument: both counts compute the same dimension. -/

single constituent, and its multiplicity is read off as a dimension. -/

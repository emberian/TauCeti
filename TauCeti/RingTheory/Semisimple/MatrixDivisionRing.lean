# The degree and the division ring of a matrix presentation are invariants

Artin--Wedderburn presents a simple Artinian ring as a matrix ring `Matᵢ(D)` over a division ring,
and a semisimple ring as a finite product of such blocks.  Mathlib supplies the presentation but
says nothing about how much of it is determined by the ring: `TauCeti.card_blocks_eq` shows the
*number* of blocks is an invariant and `TauCeti.blocks_equiv_simpleModules` matches the blocks with
the simple modules, but both are silent about the two remaining pieces of data, the size `ι` of a
block and its division ring `D`.  This file determines both, for a *single* block: it does not treat
a product of blocks; `TauCeti.wedderburn_blocks_unique` applies the result here after matching the
factors of two product presentations.

The content is a description of those two data of `A = Matᵢ(D)` in terms that transport along a
ring isomorphism.  The **column module** `ι → D`, on which `A` acts by `Matrix.mulVec`, is a simple
`A`-module (`TauCeti.Matrix.isSimpleModule_pi`), its endomorphism ring is `Dᵐᵒᵖ`
(`TauCeti.Matrix.mulOppositeRingEquivEnd`), and the regular module is the direct sum of the
`Fintype.card ι` columns (`TauCeti.Matrix.linearEquivPi`).  So the *size* is the length of the
regular module, and the *division ring* is the opposite endomorphism ring of a minimal left ideal.
Both are manifestly invariant, and a ring isomorphism `f : R ≃+* Matᵢ(D)`, read through
`RingEquiv.toSemilinearEquiv` as an `f`-semilinear isomorphism of regular modules, carries them
back to `R`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Matrix.isSimpleModule_pi`, `TauCeti.Matrix.mulOppositeRingEquivEnd`,
  `TauCeti.Matrix.linearEquivPi`: the column module of `Matᵢ(D)` is simple with endomorphism ring
  `Dᵐᵒᵖ`, and the regular module is `Fintype.card ι` copies of it.
* `TauCeti.length_eq_card_of_ringEquiv_matrix`: a ring presented as `Matᵢ(D)` has regular module of
  length `Fintype.card ι`.
* `TauCeti.nonempty_end_ringEquiv_of_ringEquiv_matrix`: for a ring presented as `Matᵢ(D)`, the
  endomorphism ring of any simple left ideal is `Dᵐᵒᵖ`.
* `TauCeti.card_eq_of_ringEquiv_matrix`, `TauCeti.nonempty_ringEquiv_of_ringEquiv_matrix` and the
  packaged `TauCeti.wedderburn_data_unique`: **two matrix presentations of the same ring have the
  same size and isomorphic division rings.**
* `TauCeti.nonempty_ringEquiv_matrix_iff`: the resulting classification, that `Matᵢ(D) ≃+* Mat_κ(E)`
  holds exactly when `ι` and `κ` have the same cardinality and `D ≃+* E`.

## Implementation notes

The index type `ι` is an arbitrary `Fintype`, not `Fin n`; the `Fin n` shape that the
Artin--Wedderburn theorems produce is the corollary `TauCeti.wedderburn_data_unique`.  `Nonempty ι`
is essential and not decoration wherever the division ring is involved: `Mat_∅(D)` is the trivial
ring for every `D`, so an empty block determines no `D` at all.  It is the hypothesis `NeZero n`
supplies in `IsSemisimpleRing.exists_ringEquiv_pi_matrix_divisionRing` and in
`TauCeti.card_blocks_eq`.  The statements about the size alone hold for every `ι`, the empty case
saying that the trivial ring has regular module of length `0`, and are stated without it.

Everything is stated for the *left* regular module, matching the convention of `IsSemisimpleRing`,
so the simple module is the column module -- on which a matrix acts by `Matrix.mulVec` -- and the
endomorphism ring, acting on the other side, comes out as `Dᵐᵒᵖ` rather than `D`.  This is also
Mathlib's convention in `IsSimpleRing.exists_ringEquiv_matrix_end_mulOpposite`.

Note that `DecidableEq ι` is needed to make `Matᵢ(D)` a ring, but not to state the transport
results, whose types mention only the multiplication and addition of `Matᵢ(D)`; those are therefore
stated without it and use `classical` internally.

The matching of the blocks of two product presentations is proved downstream in
`TauCeti/RingTheory/Semisimple/Wedderburn/Uniqueness.lean`: the coordinate central idempotents
recover the factor permutation, and the theorem in this file then identifies the data in each
factor.

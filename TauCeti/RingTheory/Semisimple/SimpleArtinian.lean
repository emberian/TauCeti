# Modules over a simple Artinian ring are classified by their dimension

Over a simple Artinian ring `R` all simple modules are isomorphic: Mathlib records this as
`IsSimpleRing.isIsotypic`, which says that any two simple submodules of any `R`-module are
isomorphic. A semisimple module is a direct sum of simple ones, so a finitely generated `R`-module
is `Sⁿ` for a **fixed** simple module `S` and a single natural number `n`, and `n` is the only
invariant there is.

This file turns that into the working statement: if `R` is moreover an algebra over a field `K` and
`M`, `N` are `R`-modules which are finite-dimensional over `K`, then

  `M ≃ₗ[R] N ↔ finrank K M = finrank K N`.

The dimension count is the bookkeeping that converts "the same number of simple summands" into a
condition that can be checked, and it is what makes the classification usable: two `R`-module
structures put on the *same* finite-dimensional `K`-vector space are automatically isomorphic. That
is exactly the input the Skolem-Noether theorem needs, in
`TauCeti/Algebra/CentralSimple/SkolemNoether.lean`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsIsotypicOfType.of_isSimpleRing`: over a simple Artinian ring, every module is isotypic
  of the type of any fixed simple module. This upgrades Mathlib's `IsSimpleRing.isIsotypic`, which
  compares simple submodules of a single module, to a comparison against a fixed simple module,
  which is what lets two different modules be compared with each other.
* `TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.nonempty_linearEquiv_of_finrank_eq`: two finite-dimensional modules over a
  finite-dimensional simple `K`-algebra with the same `K`-dimension are isomorphic.
* `TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.nonempty_linearEquiv_iff_finrank_eq`: the two-way form, the classification
  itself.

## Implementation notes

The simple module the classification compares `M` and `N` against is a minimal left ideal
`S : Submodule R R`, produced as an atom of the lattice of submodules of the regular module rather
than assumed. Taking it inside `R` rather than inside `M` is what makes it available to `M` and `N`
at once, and it inherits the `K`-module structure from `R`, so its dimension is finite and nonzero
and can be cancelled.

The two classification statements ask `R` to be finite-dimensional over `K` and do not also ask it
to be Artinian: `IsArtinianRing.of_finite` derives that from finite-dimensionality, so callers never
have to supply it. Only `TauCeti.IsIsotypicOfType.of_isSimpleRing`, which has no field in sight,
takes `IsArtinianRing R` as a hypothesis.

Simplicity of `R` is not weakened to semisimplicity: over a semisimple ring with more than one block
the dimension is not a complete invariant, since a module can distribute the same total dimension
over the blocks in different ways.

Mathlib's `IsSimpleRing.isIsotypic` compares two simple submodules of one and the same module. The
content added here is that the comparison can be made against a simple module fixed once and for
all, so that simple submodules of *different* modules become comparable: because `R` is semisimple,
a simple submodule of `M` and `S` itself are both isomorphic to ideals of `R`, and those two ideals
are isomorphic because `R` is isotypic over itself. -/

/-- **Modules over a simple Artinian algebra are classified by their dimension.** If `R` is a
finite-dimensional simple `K`-algebra and `M`, `N` are `R`-modules which are finite-dimensional over
`K`, then equal `K`-dimension forces an `R`-linear isomorphism.

Both modules are direct sums of copies of one and the same simple module `S`
(`TauCeti.IsIsotypicOfType.of_isSimpleRing`), say `Sⁿ` and `Sᵐ`; comparing dimensions gives
`n * finrank K S = m * finrank K S`, and `finrank K S ≠ 0`, so `n = m`. -/

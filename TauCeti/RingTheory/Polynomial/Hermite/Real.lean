# The probabilists' Hermite polynomials over `ℝ`

Mathlib defines `Polynomial.hermite` in `ℤ[X]`. Every analytic consumer in this library wants the
same family in `ℝ[X]`, and each of them was spelling the cast out inline as
`(hermite n).map (Int.castRingHom ℝ)`, re-deriving `eval` and `degree` facts about it at the point
of use. This file gives that cast a name and states those two facts once.

It deliberately sits beside
`TauCeti/RingTheory/Polynomial/Hermite/Derivative.lean` rather than in any analysis or probability
file: the definition mentions no measure, no inner product space, and no Gaussian, so putting it
here is what lets the *earlier* function-side files import it. A copy living in a Gaussian leaf
file would be unreachable from exactly the places that need it.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.hermiteℝ` — `Hₙ` cast into `ℝ[X]`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.eval_hermiteℝ` — evaluation agrees with `aeval` against the integer polynomial.
* `TauCeti.degree_hermiteℝ` — the cast preserves degrees, so `Hₙ` has degree exactly `n`. This is
  the exact-degree hypothesis that the polynomial-completeness machinery consumes.

# The exponential generating function of the probabilists' Hermite polynomials

Mathlib defines `Polynomial.hermite` by the one-step recursion
`hermite (n + 1) = X * hermite n - derivative (hermite n)` and develops its coefficient and
derivative API, but it records nothing about the classical exponential generating function

  `∑' n, Hₙ(x) · tⁿ / n! = exp (x · t - t² / 2)`.

This file proves that identity (target **A1** of the `OrthogonalL2Bases` roadmap, listed in
`TauCetiRoadmap/OrthogonalL2Bases/README.md` and `Suggested.lean`). It is the analytic companion of
the algebraic Hermite recurrences: the generating function is the standard tool that packages the
whole family at once and, together with the weighted-orthogonality integral, drives the
orthogonal-polynomial completeness arguments the roadmap builds on.

## Proof outline

Fix `x : ℂ` and work with the entire function `f z = exp (x·z - z²/2)` on `ℂ`. A short induction on
`n`, using only the chain rule and the defining recursion `hermite (n + 1) = X · hermite n -
derivative (hermite n)`, evaluates its iterated derivatives in closed form,

  `iteratedDeriv n f z = aeval (x - z) (hermite n) · f z`,

so at the base point `z = 0` (where `f 0 = 1`) we get `iteratedDeriv n f 0 = Hₙ(x)`. Because `f` is
complex differentiable everywhere, Mathlib's `Complex.hasSum_taylorSeries_of_entire` says `f` equals
its Taylor series about `0` at every point, which is exactly the summability statement of the
generating function at an arbitrary complex `t`.

The primary statement is the complex `HasSum` form
`Polynomial.hasSum_hermite_generating_function`, which is where the analytic content actually
lives; the real `tsum` form `Polynomial.hermite_generating_function` (the roadmap target A1)
follows from it by casting `ℝ → ℂ`. Both are stated in the `Polynomial` namespace, matching the
existing Hermite API, as upstream candidates.

/-- **Exponential generating function of the probabilists' Hermite polynomials, summable form.**
For all complex `x` and `t`, the family `Hₙ(x) · tⁿ / n!` is summable with sum
`exp (x · t - t² / 2)`, where `Hₙ = Polynomial.hermite n`.

This is the analytic heart of the identity: it carries the summability that the `tsum` form
`hermite_generating_function` discards, and it holds over all of `ℂ` (the real case is a
specialization by casting). -/

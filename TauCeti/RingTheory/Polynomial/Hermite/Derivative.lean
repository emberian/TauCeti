# Derivatives, recurrence, and parity of the probabilists' Hermite polynomials

Mathlib's `Mathlib/RingTheory/Polynomial/Hermite/Basic.lean` defines `Polynomial.hermite` by the
one-step recursion `hermite (n + 1) = X * hermite n - derivative (hermite n)` and develops its
coefficient API, but it records nothing about the *derivative* of a Hermite polynomial in closed
form. This file fills that gap with the classical lowering identity

  `derivative (hermite (n + 1)) = (n + 1) • hermite n`,

its `n`-indexed restatement `derivative (hermite n) = n • hermite (n - 1)`, the iterated form
`derivative^[k] (hermite n) = n.descFactorial k • hermite (n - k)`, and the three-term recurrence

  `hermite (n + 2) = X * hermite (n + 1) - (n + 1) • hermite n`

obtained by eliminating the derivative from Mathlib's defining recursion. These are the polynomial
inputs (target **A1**) of the `OrthogonalL2Bases` roadmap: the lowering identity is the algebraic
content behind the weighted-pairing integration-by-parts recursion
`∫ p · H_{n+1} · w = ∫ p' · Hₙ · w` and behind the Hermite generating function, and the three-term
recurrence is the standard form `Hₙ₊₁ = X·Hₙ - n·Hₙ₋₁` that orthogonal-polynomial arguments
consume. The parity theorem records `Hₙ(-x) = (-1)ⁿ Hₙ(x)` over any commutative ring. They mirror
Mathlib's existing Hermite file and are stated in the `Polynomial` namespace as upstream candidates.

/-- **Lowering (derivative) identity for the Hermite polynomials.** Differentiating the
`(n + 1)`-st probabilists' Hermite polynomial lowers the index:
`H'_{n+1} = (n + 1) · Hₙ`.

This is not a `simp` lemma because its left-hand side is already reduced by the `n`-indexed
form `Polynomial.derivative_hermite`. -/

/-- **Parity of the Hermite polynomials.** `Hₙ(-x) = (-1)ⁿ Hₙ(x)` in any commutative ring: a
coefficient of `hermite n` in degree `k` can be nonzero only when `n + k` is even
(`Polynomial.coeff_hermite_of_odd_add`), so `k` and `n` share parity and `(-x)ᵏ = (-1)ⁿ xᵏ` on every
surviving monomial. -/

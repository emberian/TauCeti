# The Chebyshev polynomials as a basis

This file packages the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind as a basis of `R[X]` when `R` is an
integral domain in which `2` is invertible. Mathlib
already proves that `T R n` has degree `n`, records its leading coefficient, and bundles the
family as `Polynomial.Chebyshev.chebyshevTsequence`.  Its generic polynomial-sequence API then
gives a basis whenever all leading coefficients are units.

The resulting basis is an algebraic prerequisite for Part C of the `OrthogonalL2Bases` roadmap.

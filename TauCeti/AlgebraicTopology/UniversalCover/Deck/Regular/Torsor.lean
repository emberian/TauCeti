# Fibres of regular connected covers as deck torsors

For a preconnected covering map with regular deck action, evaluation at any point of a fibre
identifies the deck group with that fibre. This file packages the same fact in the standard
Mathlib language of torsors: the fibre is a principal homogeneous space for the deck group.

The torsor structure is bookkeeping needed by the universal-covers roadmap Stage 2, where
pointed covers and unpointed covers differ by changing a chosen lift of the basepoint, and
regular covers are characterized by transitivity of the deck action on fibres.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.Deck.fiberTorsor`: the regular-cover specialization.
* `TauCeti.Deck.fiber_sdiv_eq_deckEquivFiber_symm`: fibre division is the unique deck
  transformation carrying the second point to the first.

## References

This supplies a small prerequisite for the regular-cover and pointed/unpointed-cover
bookkeeping in `TauCetiRoadmap/UniversalCovers/README.md`, Stage 2. It specializes the local
torsor API in `TauCeti.AlgebraicTopology.UniversalCover.Deck.Connected.Torsor` using the
regular deck-action API in `TauCeti.AlgebraicTopology.UniversalCover.Deck.Regular.Basic`.

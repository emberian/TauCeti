# Regularity from one fibre

Deck transformations commute with transport between fibres by covering-space monodromy. Thus,
over a path-connected base, transitivity of the deck action on one nonempty fibre implies
transitivity on every fibre (and also supplies surjectivity of the covering map). This reduces
regularity to a condition at a single chosen fibre.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.Deck.isRegular_iff_fiber_isPretransitive`: over a path-connected base, a covering is
  regular exactly when its deck group acts transitively on one chosen fibre.

## References

The proof uses Junyan Xu's path-lifting and monodromy API in
`Mathlib.Topology.Homotopy.Lifting`. It supplies the fibre-transport step needed for the regular
cover criterion in `TauCetiRoadmap/UniversalCovers/README.md`, Stage 2, item 8.

/-- Over a path-connected base, a covering map with a chosen point in one fibre is regular
exactly when the deck action on that one fibre is transitive.

Monodromy transports transitivity to every other fibre. The chosen point also transports to
every fibre, proving the surjectivity required by `Deck.IsRegular`. -/

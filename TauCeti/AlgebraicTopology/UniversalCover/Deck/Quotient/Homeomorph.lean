# The orbit quotient of a regular open map is homeomorphic to the base

For a regular deck action, `Deck.IsRegular.orbitQuotientEquivBase` already identifies the
deck-orbit quotient `E / Deck p` with the base `B` as a bare equivalence. This file upgrades
that equivalence to a homeomorphism when `p` is continuous and open.

This is the abstract form of the universal-covers identity `UniversalCover x₀ / π₁(X, x₀) ≃ X`,
stated for an arbitrary regular open map rather than the specific based-path cover. The
covering-map application supplies the continuity and openness hypotheses from
`IsCoveringMap.continuous` and `IsCoveringMap.isOpenMap`; the total space is not assumed
preconnected.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.Deck.continuous_orbitQuotientToBase`: a continuous map induces a continuous map
  `E / Deck p → B`.
* `TauCeti.Deck.isOpenMap_orbitQuotientToBase`: that map is open.
* `TauCeti.Deck.IsRegular.orbitQuotientHomeomorphBase`: for a regular continuous open map,
  `E / Deck p` is homeomorphic to the base.

## References

This supplies a prerequisite for the Tau Ceti universal-covers roadmap, Stage 1, where
`UniversalCover x₀ / π₁(X, x₀) ≃ X` follows from the deck-group identification via Mathlib's
`IsQuotientCoveringMap`; the present statement is its base-independent regular-cover form.

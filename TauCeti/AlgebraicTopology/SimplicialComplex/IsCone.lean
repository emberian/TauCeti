# Complexes that are cones

A simplicial complex is a *cone with apex `v`* when `v` is one of its vertices and adjoining `v`
to a face gives a face again.  This file carries that condition as the predicate `IsCone K v`,
stated for an apex `v` of the vertex type of `K` itself, so that a complex can be recognised as a
cone without changing its vertex type.

The predicate sits upstream of every construction that satisfies it, so that each construction
records its own recognition lemma in its own file: `isCone_simplex` for an abstract simplex
(`TauCeti.AlgebraicTopology.SimplicialComplex.Simplex.Basic`), `isCone_closedStar` for the closed
star of a face and `isCone_deletion` for the deletion of a face missing the apex
(`TauCeti.AlgebraicTopology.SimplicialComplex.LinkStar`), and `isCone_cone` for the cone
construction (`TauCeti.AlgebraicTopology.SimplicialComplex.Cone`), which is what identifies the
two accounts of a cone.  The point of the predicate is the basic collapsing theorem of
piecewise-linear topology, that a finite cone collapses to its apex
(`TauCeti.AlgebraicTopology.SimplicialComplex.Collapse.Cone`).

## Main definitions

/-- `K` is a **cone with apex `v`** when `v` is a vertex of `K` and adjoining `v` to a face of
`K` again gives a face of `K`.

This is the internal form of the cone condition: the apex is a vertex of the ambient type of
`K` itself, so a complex can be recognised as a cone without changing its vertex type.  The
`cone` construction satisfies it at its apex (`isCone_cone`). -/

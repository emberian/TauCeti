# Consequences of a space not being simply connected

A space whose fundamental group at some basepoint is nontrivial is not simply connected, and a
non-simply-connected space inherits the standard topological obstructions: it is not
contractible, and it is not homeomorphic to any simply connected space — in particular not to
any real topological vector space nor to `ℝ`.

These facts use the space only through the (non-)triviality of its fundamental group, so they
are stated once here for an arbitrary space and then specialised to concrete circles
(`TauCeti.AddCircle.*`, `TauCeti.UnitAddCircle.*`, `TauCeti.Circle.*`). Non-simple-connectivity
follows because a simply connected space has a subsingleton fundamental group; the
homeomorphism statements consume Mathlib's transfer of `SimplyConnectedSpace` along a homotopy
equivalence (`ContinuousMap.HomotopyEquiv.simplyConnectedSpace`, via
`Homeomorph.toHomotopyEquiv`) and the contractibility of a real topological vector space
(`RealTopologicalVectorSpace.contractibleSpace`). No Mathlib code is vendored.

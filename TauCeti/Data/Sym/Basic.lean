# Basic lemmas for symmetric powers

This file records small API extensions for Mathlib's symmetric powers, and the map
`TauCeti.Sym.ofFn` reading an ordered `n`-tuple `f : Fin n → α` as an unordered one.

`ofFn` presents `Sym α n` as a quotient of `Fin n → α`: it is surjective, and its fibres are the
orbits of the permutation action, by `TauCeti.Sym.ofFn_eq_ofFn_iff`. Nothing here is topological;
`TauCeti/Topology/Sym.lean` uses this to give `Sym α n` the quotient topology coinduced along
`ofFn`.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.Sym.ofFn`: the ordered tuple `f : Fin n → α` read as a point of `Sym α n`, and
  `TauCeti.Sym.ofFn_surjective`, that every unordered tuple arises this way.
* `TauCeti.Sym.ofFn_eq_ofFn_iff`: two ordered tuples have the same underlying unordered tuple
  exactly when one is a reindexing of the other by a permutation.
* `TauCeti.symFinTwoEquiv`: an unordered `d`-tuple over `Fin 2` is determined by how many of its
  entries are `0`, so there are `d + 1` of them.

/-- The ordered `n`-tuple `f : Fin n → α` read as an unordered `n`-tuple.

This is Mathlib's quotient map `Sym.ofVector` precomposed with `List.Vector.ofFn`; the `Fin n → α`
form is the one that carries a product topology, so it is the map that `Sym α n` carries the
quotient topology along in `TauCeti/Topology/Sym.lean`. -/

that count can be anything from `0` to `d`: the two counts sum to `d`, so the pair of them runs

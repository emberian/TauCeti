# Indicator sums over `Fin n` keyed by a natural number

`Fintype.sum_ite_eq` evaluates a sum whose indicator compares two elements of the index type.
When the comparison is instead between a natural number and the `Fin.val` of the index — as it is
whenever a family is indexed by `ℕ` and summed over `Fin n` — the index may fall outside the
range, so the value is a `dite` rather than a plain application.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.sum_ite_val_add`: a sum against the indicator of `b = k + j` picks out the summand at
  `b - j`, or vanishes when there is no such index.

/-- **A shifted indicator picks out one summand.** Summing `f` over `Fin n` against the indicator
of `b = k + j` gives `f` at the index `b - j` when that is a valid index and `j ≤ b`, and `0`
otherwise. -/

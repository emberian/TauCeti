# Opposite exact structures

Every exact structure on an additive category induces an exact structure on the opposite
category. Its conflations are the opposites of the original conflations, so its inflations are
the opposites of the original deflations and its deflations are the opposites of the original
inflations.

This file develops the self-duality of the intrinsic Quillen axioms. Identity and composition
exchange their inflation and deflation forms, while pullbacks of deflations become pushouts of
inflations and conversely.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ConflationClass.op`: the opposite of a conflation class.
* `TauCeti.ExactStructure.op`: the opposite of an exact structure.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ConflationClass.op_inflations` and
  `TauCeti.ConflationClass.op_deflations` identify the two morphism properties under duality.
* `TauCeti.ExactStructure.op_conflation_op_iff` identifies the opposite conflations coming from
  an original short complex.
* `TauCeti.ExactStructure.op_isInflation_iff` and
  `TauCeti.ExactStructure.op_isDeflation_iff` exchange inflations and deflations.

  category axioms.

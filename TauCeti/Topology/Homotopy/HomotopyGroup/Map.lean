# Functoriality of homotopy groups

Mathlib defines the generalized loop space `Ω^ N X x` and the quotient
`HomotopyGroup N X x`, but it does not yet provide the map induced by a based continuous
map. This file supplies that small API: postcomposition sends generalized loops based at
`x` to generalized loops based at `y`, descends to homotopy classes, respects identity and
composition, handles constant maps and subsingleton targets, and is a monoid homomorphism in
positive dimensions.

This is a prerequisite for the higher-homotopy API requested in the Tau Ceti universal-covers
roadmap, Stage 3 item 9, before proving that a covering map induces isomorphisms on
`π_n` for `n ≥ 2`.

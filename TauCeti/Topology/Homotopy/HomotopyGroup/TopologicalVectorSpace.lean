# Homotopy groups of a real topological vector space

Any two generalized loops with the same basepoint in a real topological vector space are
homotopic relative to the cube boundary: Mathlib's affine homotopy
`ContinuousMap.Homotopy.affine`, which interpolates linearly at each point of the cube, is
constant at the basepoint on the boundary. Consequently every homotopy group of such a space
is a subsingleton.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.GenLoop.homotopic_of_topologicalVectorSpace`: generalized loops in a real
  topological vector space with the same basepoint are homotopic.
* `TauCeti.HomotopyGroup.subsingleton_of_topologicalVectorSpace`: all homotopy groups of a
  real topological vector space are subsingletons.

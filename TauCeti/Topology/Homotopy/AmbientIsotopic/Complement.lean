# Ambient isotopy preserves the complement of the range

The point of ambient isotopy, as opposed to the naive isotopy of
`TauCeti.Topology.Homotopy.Isotopy.Basic`, is that it moves the *whole* ambient space, not just an
embedded image. Consequently an ambient isotopy carrying a map `f` to a map `g` induces a
homeomorphism of their complements `(range f)ᶜ ≃ₜ (range g)ᶜ`. This is exactly why the
geometric-topology roadmap (`TauCetiRoadmap/GeometricTopology/README.md`, layer 4, "knot theory")
insists that knot invariants be built on ambient isotopy: the complement of a knot is the basic
invariant, and it is a homeomorphism invariant of the ambient-isotopy class precisely because of
the theorem in this file. The module docstring of `TauCeti.Topology.Homotopy.Isotopy.Basic` states
this fact in prose ("an ambient isotopy induces a homeomorphism of complements"); here it is
proved.

Everything is stated for arbitrary continuous maps `f : C(X, Y)`, since the range and its
complement make sense without an embedding hypothesis; the embedded case (knots) is the intended
specialisation. Both witnessing homeomorphisms are restrictions of the ambient isotopy's final
homeomorphism `Φ.finalHomeomorph`: their underlying-value maps are `Φ.finalHomeomorph` itself and
their inverses are `Φ.finalHomeomorph.symm`, as recorded by the `coe_…_apply` lemmas below.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.AmbientIsotopy.rangeHomeomorph`: the homeomorphism `range f ≃ₜ range (Φ.final.comp f)`
  induced on ranges by an ambient isotopy `Φ`.
* `TauCeti.AmbientIsotopy.complementHomeomorph`: the homeomorphism
  `(range f)ᶜ ≃ₜ (range (Φ.final.comp f))ᶜ` induced on complements.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.AmbientIsotopy.range_final_comp`: the final homeomorphism carries `range f` onto the
  range of the moved map `Φ.final.comp f`.
* `TauCeti.AmbientIsotopic.nonempty_rangeHomeomorph` /
  `TauCeti.AmbientIsotopic.nonempty_complementHomeomorph`: ambient isotopic maps have homeomorphic
  ranges and homeomorphic complements. The complement statement is the knot-invariance fact.

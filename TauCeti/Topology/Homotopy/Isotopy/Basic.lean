# Isotopy and ambient isotopy

An *isotopy* between two continuous maps is a homotopy whose every time slice is a topological
embedding, and an *ambient isotopy* of a space `Y` is a
homotopy from the identity of `Y` whose level-preserving total map `I × Y → I × Y` is a
homeomorphism. These are the point-set foundations that the geometric-topology roadmap
(`TauCetiRoadmap/GeometricTopology`) asks for once, in full generality, before specialising.
`Isotopy` deliberately uses the slice-wise, homotopy-through-embeddings convention.
Burde--Zieschang, *Knots*, Chapter 1, Definition 1.1 instead requires the associated
level-preserving map `I × X → I × Y` to be an embedding. The two conditions agree when `X` is
compact and `Y` is Hausdorff, but the slice-wise condition is weaker for the arbitrary spaces
allowed here. `AmbientIsotopy` follows their Definition 1.2, generalized to this continuous
topological setting. The non-ambient relation is a general point-set notion of isotopy; later
knot-equivalence foundations should use ambient isotopy, specialized as needed to smooth
embeddings `S¹ ↪ M`. Later geometric-topology foundations specialize these notions as appropriate
for locally flat isotopy, diffeotopies, and concordance.

## A warning: non-ambient isotopy is degenerate for knots

The non-ambient relation `Isotopy`/`Isotopic` is *not* the right equivalence for classical knot
theory. It records a moving embedded image, but it need not extend to a motion of the ambient
space and therefore need not preserve knot complements. *Ambient* isotopy is the relation with
knot-theoretic content: an ambient isotopy induces a homeomorphism of complements, so knot
invariants must be built on `AmbientIsotopy` and the `AmbientIsotopic` equivalence from
`TauCeti.Topology.Homotopy.AmbientIsotopic.Basic`, not on `Isotopy`/`Isotopic`. See
Burde--Zieschang, *Knots*, Chapter 1 §A, where ambient isotopy (Definition 1.2) is introduced
after their stronger level-preserving notion of non-ambient isotopy (Definition 1.1).

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Isotopy f₀ f₁`: a homotopy from `f₀` to `f₁` through topological embeddings.
* `TauCeti.Isotopic f₀ f₁`: the proposition that such an isotopy exists. This is the reusable
  general non-ambient relation; knot-equivalence layers should instead use `AmbientIsotopic` from
  `TauCeti.Topology.Homotopy.AmbientIsotopic.Basic`.
* `TauCeti.AmbientIsotopy Y`: a homotopy of `Y` from the identity whose total
  level-preserving map is a homeomorphism.
* `TauCeti.AmbientIsotopy.trans` / `TauCeti.AmbientIsotopy.symm`: the composition and inverse of
  ambient isotopies, the closure operations that make ambient isotopy an equivalence relation.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Isotopy.isEmbedding_left` / `isEmbedding_right`: the endpoints of an isotopy are
  embeddings.
* `TauCeti.Isotopic.refl` / `TauCeti.Isotopic.symm` / `TauCeti.Isotopic.trans`: isotopy is
  reflexive on embeddings, symmetric, and transitive.
* `TauCeti.Isotopic.homotopic`: isotopic maps are homotopic.
* `TauCeti.AmbientIsotopy.isotopy` / `TauCeti.AmbientIsotopy.isotopic`: an ambient isotopy
  carries any embedding `f` to the isotopic embedding `Φ.final ∘ f`. This is the "ambient
  isotopy implies isotopy" direction.
* `TauCeti.AmbientIsotopy.final_trans` / `TauCeti.AmbientIsotopy.symm_final_final` /
  `TauCeti.AmbientIsotopy.final_symm_final`: the final maps of the composite and inverse ambient
  isotopies, and that the inverse final map undoes the original on both sides.

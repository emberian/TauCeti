# Approximating a lower semicontinuous function from below

On a pseudometric space, an `ℝ≥0∞`-valued lower semicontinuous function is the pointwise supremum
of an increasing sequence of bounded Lipschitz functions. This file builds that sequence
explicitly, as the truncated inf-convolution

`lscApproxAux f n x = ⨅ y, ((f y ⊓ n).toReal + n * dist x y)`,

and packages it as a sequence in `Ω →ᵇ ℝ≥0`.

Monotone approximation from below by *bounded continuous* functions is what turns the monotone
convergence theorem into a lower semicontinuity statement for integrals against a varying measure,
which is why the target of the approximation is `Ω →ᵇ ℝ≥0` rather than merely a continuous
function: the weak topology on measures is defined by pairing with exactly these test functions.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.lscApproxAux`: the truncated inf-convolution, a real-valued function bounded by `n` and
  Lipschitz with constant `n`.
* `TauCeti.iSup_ofReal_lscApproxAux`: for lower semicontinuous `f`, the approximations increase
  pointwise to `f`.
* `TauCeti.lscApprox`: the same sequence bundled as bounded continuous `ℝ≥0`-valued functions.
* `TauCeti.LowerSemicontinuous.exists_boundedContinuous_monotone_iSup_eq`: the resulting
  interface, stating only that some monotone sequence of bounded continuous functions has
  pointwise supremum `f`.

## Implementation notes

The inf-convolution is taken of the truncation `f ⊓ n` rather than of `f` itself, so that the
`n`-th approximation is bounded by `n`; truncating is what allows infinite values of `f` to be
reached in the limit. The infimum is formed in `ℝ` (rather than in `ℝ≥0∞`) because the Lipschitz
estimate is then Mathlib's `LipschitzWith.of_le_add_mul`, and because bounded continuous functions
are the intended target. The construction is the one used for `LipschitzOnWith.extend_real`.

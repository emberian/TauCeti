# Connected components

This file records general topological properties of the quotient of a space by its connected
components.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.Homeomorph.image_connectedComponent`: a homeomorphism maps a connected component onto
  the connected component of the image point.
* `TauCeti.instT1SpaceConnectedComponents`: the connected-components quotient of any topological
  space is a T1 space.
* `TauCeti.finite_connectedComponents_of_finite_irreducibleComponents`: finiteness of the
  irreducible components implies finiteness of the connected components.

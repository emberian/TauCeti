# The unitary and special unitary matrix groups are compact

For a finite index type `n` and `𝕜 = ℝ` or `ℂ` (any `RCLike` field), the unitary group
`Matrix.unitaryGroup n 𝕜` and the special unitary group `Matrix.specialUnitaryGroup n 𝕜` are
compact subsets of `Matrix n n 𝕜` in the entrywise topology, hence compact topological groups.

The argument is the classical one. A unitary matrix has unit rows, so all its entries lie in the
closed unit ball (Mathlib's `entry_norm_bound_of_unitary`); the unitary group is therefore contained
in the compact set of matrices with entries in that ball, and it is closed because it is cut out by
the equations `star A * A = 1` and `A * star A = 1`. The special unitary group adds the closed
condition `det A = 1`.

Mathlib already supplies the topological group structure on `unitary R` for a topological star
monoid `R` (`isClosed_unitary` and the `IsTopologicalGroup (unitary R)` instance), so for the
unitary group only compactness is new. The special unitary group is a different submonoid, carrying
its own `Group` instance in `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/UnitaryGroup.lean`, so its `ContinuousInv` and
`IsTopologicalGroup` instances are recorded here too. Those instances and its closedness need no
`RCLike` hypothesis, and are stated over a topological commutative star ring instead; only
compactness is `RCLike`-specific. Hausdorffness is not proved here: it
is inherited from the ambient matrix topology whenever `𝕜` is Hausdorff.

This is the setup the compact-group representation theory of `SU(2)` runs on; see
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/SU2/Basic.lean`.

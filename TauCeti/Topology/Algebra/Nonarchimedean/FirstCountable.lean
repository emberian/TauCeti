# A first-countable nonarchimedean group has a decreasing basis of open subgroups

Henkel's open mapping theorem runs a successive-approximation argument down a *sequence* of
neighbourhoods of zero, each one absorbing the previous error. Two properties of that sequence are
used and neither comes for free: its terms must be **subgroups**, so that a sum of errors drawn
from one term stays inside it, and it must be **decreasing**, so that the tail of the construction
stays inside the neighbourhood it started in.

Nonarchimedean gives the first, countable generation of `𝓝 0` the second, and this file combines
them. Neither hypothesis alone suffices — a
nonarchimedean group has open subgroups arbitrarily close to zero but possibly uncountably many
with no cofinal sequence among them, and a first-countable group has a decreasing countable basis
whose terms need not be subgroups.

## Main results

* `NonarchimedeanAddGroup.exists_antitone_basis_openAddSubgroup`: the neighbourhoods of zero
  admit an antitone basis consisting of open subgroups, indexed by `ℕ`.

## References

* L. Henkel, *An Open Mapping Theorem for rings which have a zero sequence of units*,
  [arXiv:1407.5647](https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.5647), whose approximation argument needs such a
  sequence.

/-- **A first-countable nonarchimedean additive group has an antitone basis of open subgroups at
zero.**

Both hypotheses are used, and only where stated: nonarchimedean makes the open subgroups a basis
of `𝓝 0` at all, and countable generation of `𝓝 0` is what extracts an antitone *sequence* from
that basis. Global first countability is more than is needed and is not assumed. -/

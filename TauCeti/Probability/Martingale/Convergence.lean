# Martingale convergence theorems

Lévy's downward theorem for conditional expectations along a decreasing filtration.

This is the flagship of the reverse-martingale infrastructure: the finite-horizon reversal
(`Martingale/Reverse.lean`), the pathwise crossing adapters (`Martingale/Crossings/`), the
reverse-martingale upcrossing bound (`Crossings/Bounds.lean`), and the antitone-limit existence
result (`Martingale/AntitoneLimit.lean`) all feed into `tendsto_ae_condExp_iInf`.

## Main results

- `tendsto_ae_condExp_iInf`: Lévy's downward theorem — for antitone `𝔽`, the sequence
  `μ[f | 𝔽 n]` converges a.e. to `μ[f | ⨅ n, 𝔽 n]` (the reverse-martingale limit). This is
  the roadmap Layer-4 target, spelled in the Mathlib convergence-API grammar (conclusion-first)
  required by the naming convention.
- `tendsto_eLpNorm_condExp_iInf`: the L¹ form of the same theorem — the convergence also holds in
  `L¹`, i.e. `eLpNorm (μ[f | 𝔽 n] - μ[f | ⨅ n, 𝔽 n]) 1 μ → 0`. This is the follow-up Layer-4
  target and the form most downstream analytic uses want; it mirrors Mathlib's upward
  `MeasureTheory.tendsto_eLpNorm_condExp`.

/-- **Identification of the reverse-martingale limit.** If `μ[f | 𝔽 n]` converges to `Xlim` both
almost everywhere and in `L¹`, along an antitone filtration, then `Xlim` is the conditional
expectation of `f` on the tail σ-algebra `⨅ n, 𝔽 n`.

The proof uses the a.e. convergence to make `Xlim` measurable for `⨅ n, 𝔽 n`, and the `L¹`
convergence to transport the tower property `μ[μ[f | 𝔽 n] | ⨅ n, 𝔽 n] =ᵐ μ[f | ⨅ n, 𝔽 n]` to the
limit. -/

/-- Lévy's downward theorem, proving the almost-everywhere and `L¹` forms together.

The `L¹` convergence is not an afterthought of the a.e. convergence: the Vitali step that upgrades
a.e. convergence of the uniformly integrable family `μ[f | 𝔽ₙ]` to `L¹` convergence is what
identifies the a.e. limit as `μ[f | ⨅ₙ 𝔽ₙ]` in the first place. Proving the two conclusions in one
pass avoids running that step twice; the public `tendsto_ae_condExp_iInf` and
`tendsto_eLpNorm_condExp_iInf` are its two projections. -/

/-- **Conditional expectation converges along a decreasing filtration (Lévy's downward theorem).**

For a decreasing filtration `𝔽ₙ`, the sequence `μ[f | 𝔽ₙ]` converges almost surely to
`μ[f | ⨅ₙ 𝔽ₙ]` — the reverse-martingale (Lévy downward) limit. As in Mathlib's upward
`MeasureTheory.tendsto_ae_condExp`, no integrability hypothesis is needed: `condExp` vanishes on
non-integrable arguments, so the statement is trivial there. -/

/-- **Conditional expectation converges in `L¹` along a decreasing filtration (Lévy's downward
theorem, `L¹` form).**

For a decreasing filtration `𝔽ₙ`, the sequence `μ[f | 𝔽ₙ]` converges in `L¹` to `μ[f | ⨅ₙ 𝔽ₙ]`.
This upgrades the almost-everywhere statement `tendsto_ae_condExp_iInf`: the conditional
expectations `μ[f | 𝔽ₙ]` of a fixed integrable function form a uniformly integrable family, so
their a.e. convergence is convergence in `L¹` by Vitali's theorem. As in Mathlib's upward
`MeasureTheory.tendsto_eLpNorm_condExp`, which this is the downward analogue of, no integrability
hypothesis is needed: `condExp` vanishes on non-integrable arguments, so the statement is trivial
there. -/

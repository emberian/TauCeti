# Birkhoff averages of the `Lᵖ` composition operator

The Birkhoff sums and averages of the composition (Koopman) operator of a measure-preserving map
`T` on `Lᵖ` are elements of `Lᵖ`, while the ergodic theorems a probabilist states are about the
pointwise Birkhoff averages `birkhoffAverage ℝ T f n` of an observable. This file records that the
two agree: an `Lᵖ` Birkhoff average of `g` is represented by the pointwise Birkhoff average of the
coercion `⇑g`. For another representative `f =ᵐ[μ] ⇑g`, compose with Mathlib's
`Measure.QuasiMeasurePreserving.birkhoffAverage_ae_eq_of_ae_eq`.

## Main results

* `coeFn_iterate_compMeasurePreserving` — iterating the composition operator composes with the
  iterated transformation;
* `coeFn_birkhoffSum_compMeasurePreserving` and `coeFn_birkhoffAverage_compMeasurePreserving` —
  the Birkhoff sums and averages of the composition operator are represented by the pointwise
  Birkhoff sums and averages of the coercion of the argument.

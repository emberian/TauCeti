# Fixed points of a measure-preserving transformation on `Lᵖ`

This file relates membership in Mathlib's fixed submodule for the `Lᵖ` composition isometry to
almost-everywhere invariance of representatives. This is the closed subspace onto which the mean
ergodic projection in the Koopman route to de Finetti's theorem will project.

It also records the simp lemma `coe_compMeasurePreservingₗᵢ`, which identifies the map underlying
the composition isometry with Mathlib's composition operator
`MeasureTheory.Lp.compMeasurePreserving`, so that statements phrased with the isometry can be
rewritten into the form the lemmas about representatives use.

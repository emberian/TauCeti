# The mean ergodic projection is conditional expectation given the invariants

Mathlib's von Neumann mean ergodic theorem gives convergence to an orthogonal projection, and the
probabilistic form of the theorem still needs that projection identified with a conditional
expectation. This file carries out the identification for the `L²` composition (Koopman) operator
of a measure-preserving map `T`: the mean ergodic projection `metProjection T hT` of
`TauCeti.Probability.Ergodic.MeanErgodic` is Mathlib's `condExpL2` for the invariant σ-algebra
`MeasurableSpace.invariants T`. Passing from `condExpL2` to the conditional expectation
`μ[· | MeasurableSpace.invariants T]` of representatives costs exactly what Mathlib's
`MemLp.condExpL2_ae_eq_condExp'` costs — σ-finiteness of the trimmed measure
`μ.trim (MeasurableSpace.invariants_le T)` and integrability of the observable — so the pointwise
statements below assume those while the `condExpL2` ones do not. Both hold automatically on a
finite measure space.

The identification is not a simp step: it rests on `fixedSpace_eq_lpMeas_invariants`, which
replaces an almost invariant observable by an invariantly measurable representative, together with
the fact that both operators are orthogonal projections onto the resulting common subspace of
`L²`.

Feeding the identification into `birkhoffAverage_tendsto_metProjection` turns the Hilbert-space
statement into the probabilists' mean ergodic theorem: the time averages
`birkhoffAverage ℝ T f n` of an integrable square-integrable observable converge in `L²` to
`μ[f | MeasurableSpace.invariants T]`. The translation between the operator Birkhoff averages of
the composition operator and the pointwise Birkhoff averages of a representative is
`coeFn_birkhoffAverage_compMeasurePreserving` of `TauCeti.Probability.Ergodic.BirkhoffLp`.

## Main results

* `metProjection_eq_condExpL2` — the mean ergodic projection is `condExpL2` for the invariant
  σ-algebra, for an arbitrary measure;
* `metProjection_ae_eq_condExp` — its representatives are the conditional expectation given the
  invariant σ-algebra;
* `condExpL2_invariants_eq_self_iff` — `condExpL2` for the invariant σ-algebra fixes exactly the
  almost everywhere invariant observables, again for an arbitrary measure;
* `birkhoffAverage_tendsto_condExpL2` — the Birkhoff averages of the composition operator converge
  to `condExpL2`, and `tendsto_eLpNorm_birkhoffAverage_sub_condExp` — the pointwise Birkhoff
  averages converge in `L²` to the conditional expectation;
* `tendsto_integral_abs_birkhoffAverage_sub_condExp` — the `L¹` form of the previous item, on a
  finite measure: the mean absolute deviation of the Birkhoff averages from the conditional
  expectation tends to `0`. This is the shape a consumer integrating against a bounded weight
  wants, and it needs no integrability hypothesis of its own.

The `Exchangeability` roadmap records this identification as the Layer 5 milestone
`proj_eq_condexp`, whose migration source is the `Ergodic` subtree of
`cameronfreer/exchangeability`. Nothing here is a port: the statements are for an arbitrary
measure-preserving map rather than the path-space shift, and the proofs consume Mathlib's
`condExpL2` and von Neumann mean ergodic theorem.

Both sides are the orthogonal projection onto the same closed subspace of `L²`: the observables
fixed by composition with `T` are exactly those almost everywhere strongly measurable for
`MeasurableSpace.invariants T`, by `fixedSpace_eq_lpMeas_invariants`. -/

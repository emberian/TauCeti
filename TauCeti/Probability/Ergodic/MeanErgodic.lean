# Mean ergodic projection for measure-preserving maps

This file defines the orthogonal projection from vector-valued `L²` onto the fixed space of the
composition operator associated to a measure-preserving endomorphism. It characterizes the
projection by membership, fixed points, its range, and the orthogonal error.

The main theorem, `birkhoffAverage_tendsto_metProjection`, says that the Birkhoff averages of the
composition operator converge in `L²` to this projection. It specializes Mathlib's von Neumann
mean ergodic theorem
`ContinuousLinearMap.tendsto_birkhoffAverage_orthogonalProjection` to the `L²` composition
isometry.

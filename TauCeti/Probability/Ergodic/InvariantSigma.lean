# Invariant measurable representatives

Within the ambient-almost-everywhere strongly measurable real-valued functions, this file
identifies almost-everywhere invariance under a nonsingular endomorphism with almost-everywhere
strong measurability for Mathlib's invariant σ-algebra.

The nontrivial direction replaces an almost invariant real-valued function by a pointwise
invariant representative.  For an ambient-measurable representative `g`, the replacement is the
real part of

`limsup (fun n => g (T^[n] ω))`.

Dropping the first term does not change this limsup, so the replacement is pointwise invariant.
Nonsingularity transports the original a.e. invariance along every iterate, making the replacement
a.e. equal to `g`.

## Main results

* `aestronglyMeasurable_invariants_of_comp_ae_eq` — an ambient-a.e. strongly measurable,
  a.e. invariant function has an invariant measurable representative;
* `aestronglyMeasurable_invariants_iff_comp_ae_eq` — the characteristic equivalence;
* `fixedSpace_eq_lpMeas_invariants` — the `Lᵖ` fixed space is exactly Mathlib's `lpMeas` subspace
  for the invariant σ-algebra.

The construction and proof are adapted from
`cameronfreer/exchangeability`, `Exchangeability/Ergodic/ShiftInvariantRepresentatives.lean` and
`Exchangeability/Ergodic/InvariantSigma.lean`, at commit
`e0532e59ceff23edab44dda9ab0655debbc9cc22`.  This version is generalized from the path-space shift
to an arbitrary nonsingular endomorphism at the function level (and a measure-preserving one on
`Lᵖ`) and uses
`MeasurableSpace.invariants` directly, as required by the Exchangeability roadmap.

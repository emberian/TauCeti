# The Koopman Markov operator on measurable-function germs

This file supplies the algebraic part of the generic Koopman lane in the Exchangeability roadmap.
For a measure-preserving endomorphism `T`, composition `g ↦ g ∘ T` is bundled as a real-linear
operator on almost-everywhere measurable real-valued functions.  It preserves one and
multiplication, is positive and monotone, and its powers are composition with the corresponding
iterates of `T`.

Mathlib already provides the underlying operation as `AEEqFun.compMeasurePreserving`, as well as
a norm-preserving additive composition map on `Lᵖ`, which is an isometry when `1 ≤ p`.  Unlike
that `Lᵖ` composition map, the Koopman operator here is also multiplicative.  The later `L∞` API
can restrict this operator to essentially bounded germs.

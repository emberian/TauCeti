# Pushing the base of a composition-product along a map the kernel factors through

Mathlib's `MeasureTheory.Measure.compProd` records how `μ ⊗ₘ κ` reacts to operations on the
kernel, but not what happens when the *base* measure is pushed forward. In general nothing does:
`(μ ⊗ₘ κ).map (Prod.map f id)` cannot be read off `μ.map f`, because `κ` still sees the finer
information carried by the points of the source. The one case in which it can is exactly the case
in which `κ` itself factors through `f`, and that case is the content of this file.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.Measure.map_prodMap_compProd_comap` — for `f : W → Y` measurable and `κ : Kernel Y Z`,
  `(μ ⊗ₘ κ.comap f hf).map (Prod.map f id) = μ.map f ⊗ₘ κ`.

/-- If a kernel factors through a measurable map `f : W → Y`, then pushing the base of the
composition-product forward along `f` gives back the composition-product over the pushed-forward
base: `(μ ⊗ₘ κ.comap f hf).map (Prod.map f id) = μ.map f ⊗ₘ κ`.

Without the factorization hypothesis the left-hand side genuinely depends on more than `μ.map f`,
so the `comap` on the left is not decoration. -/

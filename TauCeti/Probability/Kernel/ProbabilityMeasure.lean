# Markov kernels, bundled fibrewise

`IsMarkovKernel κ` says exactly that every fibre of `κ : Kernel β Ω` is a probability measure.
Consumers that want a *random probability measure* — a `β → ProbabilityMeasure Ω`, the shape
predicates like `MixedIIDWith` and `ConditionallyIIDWith` take as their witness — must pair each
fibre with that instance by hand. `Kernel.probabilityMeasure` does it once.

The bundling is canonical: there is no choice to make, and correspondingly no probability-measure
lemma here, since the type already carries it.

## Main results

* `Kernel.probabilityMeasure` — the bundled kernel;
* `Kernel.probabilityMeasure_toMeasure` — its underlying measure is the kernel's fibre, and the
  abstraction boundary for importing modules;
* `Kernel.measurable_probabilityMeasure` — measurability into `ProbabilityMeasure Ω`.

Stated for an arbitrary Markov kernel rather than for any particular construction. The regular
conditional distribution `ProbabilityTheory.condDistrib` is one instance; conditioning on a
sub-σ-algebra is that instance with the conditioning map `id`, which is how the de Finetti
directing measures arise.

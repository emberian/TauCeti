# Exchangeable path laws are contractable

This file records the path-space form of the Layer 0 bridge from exchangeability to
contractability: an exchangeable finite measure on one-sided path space is invariant under
every strictly increasing reindexing of time. The process-level theorem remains available in
`TauCeti.Probability.Exchangeability.Contractability`; this file is the corresponding
`ExchangeableLaw` to `ContractableLaw` adapter.

# Exchangeable laws on path space

This file adds the path-law formulation of full exchangeability for measures on `ℕ → α`.
The process-level definitions in `TauCeti.Probability.Exchangeability.Basic` remain the main
user-facing API for stochastic processes; `ExchangeableLaw` names the equivalent path-space
viewpoint needed by π-system, invariant-σ-algebra, and shift arguments.

Everything here is pure path space: it depends only on the coordinate-reindexing and prefix
machinery of `Basic` and the finite permutation extension of `PermutationExtension`. The
process-level ↔ path-law bridges live in
`TauCeti.Probability.Exchangeability.PathSpace.Law.Bridge`, which imports both this file and
`FullyExchangeable`. No measure-theoretic infrastructure is vendored.

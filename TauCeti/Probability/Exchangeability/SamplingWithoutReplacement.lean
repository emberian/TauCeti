# Finite exchangeability as sampling without replacement

This file identifies every shorter marginal of a finite exchangeable process with sampling
without replacement from its observed finite population. Given a population law
`ρ : Measure (κ → α)`, `sampleWithoutReplacement ρ` first draws `x ∼ ρ`, independently
draws a uniform injective selection `k : ι → κ`, and returns `x ∘ k`.

The main theorem says that if the first `n` coordinates of a process are exchangeable, then
sampling `m ≤ n` entries without replacement from that random `n`-tuple has exactly the original
`m`-prefix law. This is the representation half of the finite de Finetti argument: the companion
with-replacement law is the product of the empirical measure, and the collision estimate in
`TauCeti.Probability.UniformSampling` then controls their difference.

The proof averages the exchangeable law over all injective selections. Every selection has the
same law by `ExchangeableAt.blockLaw_eq_prefixLaw_of_injective`, so the average has that law too.

## Main declarations

* `sampleWithoutReplacement` — sample a random finite population at uniformly chosen distinct
  indices;
* `sampleWithoutReplacement_apply` — its evaluation as the average of the selected laws;
* `ExchangeableAt.sampleWithoutReplacement_eq_prefixLaw` — the finite exchangeable
  without-replacement representation.

## References

* Roadmap: `TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`, Layer 8, “finite de Finetti bounds”.
* P. Diaconis and D. Freedman, “Finite exchangeable sequences”, *Annals of Probability* 8

No material is adapted from `cameronfreer/exchangeability`; its three de Finetti routes concern
infinite exchangeable sequences rather than quantitative finite approximation.

/-- Reindex a finite population by a simultaneously supplied selection of its indices.

This lemma is private because the function is only the implementation map in
`sampleWithoutReplacement`. The measurable-space hypothesis on the finite population index is
discrete: it lets the variable index be split into countably many measurable fibres. -/

/-- The law obtained by sampling a random finite population without replacement.

First draw a population `x : κ → α` with law `ρ`; independently and uniformly draw an injective
selection `k : ι → κ`; then return the sample `i ↦ x (k i)`. If no injective selection exists,
Mathlib's `uniformOn` convention makes this the zero measure.

The assumptions on the population index are part of the definition, not just of its API. The
population index is finite because uniform counting only distributes mass over finitely many
injective selections, and its singletons are measurable because that is what
`measurable_samplePopulation` uses to establish measurability of the pushforward map for an
arbitrary `α`. -/

/-- **Finite exchangeability is sampling without replacement.** If the first `n` coordinates are
exchangeable, then drawing `m ≤ n` distinct positions uniformly from that random `n`-tuple has
exactly the law of the first `m` coordinates.

This is an equality of measures, not merely an eventwise bound. The later finite de Finetti bound
compares its left-hand side with sampling *with* replacement, using the collision estimate in
`UniformSampling.lean`. -/

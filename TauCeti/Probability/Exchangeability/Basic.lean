# Basic exchangeability definitions

This file starts the Layer 0 exchangeability API: indexed block laws of a family,
prefix laws, path laws, finite exchangeability, full exchangeability, and
contractability. The definitions are intentionally hypothesis-light; measurability
hypotheses enter only in lemmas that compose `Measure.map`s.

`blockLaw` and its characteristic lemmas are stated for an arbitrary index type; the remaining
definitions here are about the order structure of `ℕ` (prefixes, shifts, strictly increasing
selections) and stay sequence-level.

The prefix/tail measurable equivalence `prefixSplitEquiv` is an exception on both counts: it is
neither a roadmap signature nor adapted from the pinned sources, but general infrastructure that
several exchangeability arguments need in order to reindex a sequence as a length-`r` prefix paired
with the tail from index `r`. It lives here because it is stated purely in terms of the order
structure of `ℕ`, with no measure and no process.

The remaining declarations follow the roadmap signatures in
`TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md` and
`TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/Suggested.lean`, Layer 0. They are adapted from the
`cameronfreer/exchangeability` Layer 0 sources pinned at
`e0532e59ceff23edab44dda9ab0655debbc9cc22`, with Tau Ceti API names and hypotheses.

numbers, and `ExchangeableFamily` selects from an arbitrary type. Sequence-level users get the

# Constant mixing measures

This file characterizes `MixedIIDWith` for a constant mixing representative. It is equivalent to
plain independence with common marginal law.

## Main results

* `MixedIIDWith.blockLaw_eq_pi_of_const`, `MixedIIDWith.aemeasurable_of_const`,
  `MixedIIDWith.map_eq_of_const` — what a constant mixing representative says: every injective
  block law is the `m`-fold product of `p`, every coordinate is a.e. measurable, and every
  coordinate has law `p`.
* `mixedIIDWith_const_iff_iIndepFun_and_map_eq` — a constant `p` is a mixing representative exactly
  when the coordinates are independent with common law `p`.

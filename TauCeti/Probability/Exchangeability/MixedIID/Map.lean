# Coordinatewise maps of mixed i.i.d. families

This file completes the Layer 0 closure API for the exchangeability symmetry classes: applying a
measurable map `f : α → β` to every coordinate of a mixed i.i.d. family gives another mixed
i.i.d. family, whose mixing representative is the coordinatewise pushforward
`ω ↦ (ν ω).map f` of the original mixing representative `ν`.

`TauCeti.Probability.Exchangeability.Map` already records this closure for `ExchangeableAt`,
`Exchangeable`, `FullyExchangeable`, and `Contractable`.  `MixedIID` is the remaining
symmetry class from the roadmap item asking for closure of each class under the coordinatewise
pushforward `X ↦ (f ∘ Xᵢ)` (`TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`, Layer 0). The
transformation of the mixing representative is the expected one: the mixture identity for the
mapped family is the original identity with each product factor pushed forward by `f`.

`map_values` holds at an arbitrary index type; `mixedIID_of_mixedIID_pathLaw` below is genuinely
sequence-level, since it transfers along the `ℕ`-indexed path law.

The proof runs at the level of the finite-block mixture identity. It reuses `map_blockLaw`
(the coordinatewise pushforward of a block law), the random-product measurability of
`TauCeti.MeasureTheory.Measure.ProductKernel`, the naturality of `bind`
(`TauCeti.MeasureTheory.map_bind`), and Mathlib's product pushforward `Measure.pi_map_pi`.
It needs no material from `cameronfreer/exchangeability` beyond the existing `MixedIIDWith` API
this repository already carries.

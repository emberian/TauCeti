# Basic implications from mixed i.i.d.-ness

This file records the first implication out of the Layer 0 mixed-i.i.d. API:
mixed i.i.d. processes are exchangeable.  The definition
`MixedIIDWith μ X ν` already states that every injective finite coordinate selection
has the same product-mixture law, so the exchangeability proof is just the specialization to
the permuted and identity selections of `Fin n`.

The resulting exchangeability theorem is one of the Layer 0 bridges listed in
`TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/Suggested.lean`; the contractability corollaries use the same
injective-block identity, since strictly increasing finite selections are injective.

These declarations follow the `cameronfreer/exchangeability` Layer 0 implication lattice
pinned at `e0532e59ceff23edab44dda9ab0655debbc9cc22`, but use Tau Ceti's current
`MixedIIDWith` API, where the finite-block mixture identity is already stated for
arbitrary injective selections.

# Basic implications from conditional i.i.d.-ness

The symmetry consequences of the conditional predicate: a conditionally i.i.d. sequence is
exchangeable, and it is contractable.

The witness-level forms compose the projection `mixedIIDWith_of_conditionallyIIDWith` with the
corresponding `MixedIIDWith` implication, so the directing measure is carried through unchanged; the
existential forms destruct `exists_directing` and apply them. This is the same layering as the
mixture side, where `MixedIIDWith.exchangeable` does the work and `MixedIID.exchangeable` destructs
the existential.

The file is therefore the conditional counterpart of
`TauCeti.Probability.Exchangeability.MixedIID.Implications`, and sits one layer above
`ConditionallyIID.Basic` for the same reason that file sits above `MixedIID.Basic`: the projection
belongs with the predicate, the implications out of it do not.

## Main results

* `ConditionallyIIDWith.exchangeable`, `ConditionallyIIDWith.contractable` — at a named directing
  measure.
* `ConditionallyIID.exchangeable`, `ConditionallyIID.contractable` — their existential corollaries.

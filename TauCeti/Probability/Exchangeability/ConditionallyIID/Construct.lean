# The canonical conditionally i.i.d. process

Every measurable family of probability measures is *realized* as a directing measure. Given a
probability measure `π` on a parameter space `T` and a measurable family
`P : T → ProbabilityMeasure α`, the law

```text
iidMixtureLaw π P = ∫ δ_t ⊗ (P t)^{⊗ℕ} dπ(t)
```

on `T × (ℕ → α)` is the two-stage experiment "draw the parameter `t` from `π`, then sample the
coordinates i.i.d. from `P t`", with the parameter retained as the first coordinate. Its
coordinate process `X n ω = ω.2 n` is **conditionally i.i.d.** with directing measure
`ω ↦ P ω.1`, and the law of that directing measure is the prescribed `π.map P`.

This is the converse direction of the Layer 6 uniqueness statements: `mixedIID_mixingLaw_unique`
and `conditionallyIID_ae_unique` say a directing measure is pinned down by the process, and the
theorems here say every law on `ProbabilityMeasure α` of the form `π.map P` does arise. Before
this file the only `ConditionallyIIDWith` witnesses available were the constant one
(`ConditionallyIIDWith.of_iIndepFun_identDistrib`, i.e. plain i.i.d.) and the one the hard
de Finetti theorem extracts from contractability; nothing produced a *prescribed* nondegenerate
directing measure.

Note that the conclusion is the sharp conditional predicate, not merely the mixture identity: the
generating construction ties the process to `ν` and not just to its law, which is exactly the
difference the roadmap insists on
(`TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`, "Standing hypotheses").

## Main results

* `iidMixtureLaw` — the canonical two-stage law, with `isProbabilityMeasure_iidMixtureLaw` and the
  marginal `iidMixtureLaw_map_fst`.
* `conditionallyIIDWith_iidMixtureLaw` — the coordinate process is conditionally i.i.d. with
  directing measure `ω ↦ P ω.1`, and the corollaries `mixedIIDWith_iidMixtureLaw`,
  `exchangeable_iidMixtureLaw`, `contractable_iidMixtureLaw`.
* `iidMixtureLaw_map_directing` — the directing measure has the prescribed law `π.map P`, and
  `pathLaw_iidMixtureLaw` reads the path law as the `π.map P`-mixture of infinite powers.
* `exists_map_eq_dirac_of_iIndepFun_iidMixtureLaw` — the construction is genuinely richer than
  i.i.d.: independent coordinates force the mixing law `π.map P` to be a point mass.

This advances `TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`, Layer 6 (directing measures), and
supplies the construction the roadmap's coin-flipping worked example instantiates
(`TauCeti/Probability/Exchangeability/ConditionallyIID/CoinFlips.lean`). It needs no material from
`cameronfreer/exchangeability`, whose `ConditionallyIID` names the weaker mixture identity.

/-- **The canonical conditionally i.i.d. law.** Draw a parameter `t` from `π`, then sample the
coordinates i.i.d. from `P t`, keeping `t` as the first coordinate of the sample space
`T × (ℕ → α)`.

Retaining the parameter is what makes this a *conditional* construction rather than only a mixture
of i.i.d. laws: the sequence and its directing measure live on the same space, so the joint law of
the two can be compared with the disintegration `ConditionallyIIDWith` demands. -/

/-- **The canonical process is conditionally i.i.d.** For a measurable family `P`, the coordinate
process of `iidMixtureLaw π P` is conditionally i.i.d. with directing measure `ω ↦ P ω.1`: along
every finite selection of distinct coordinates, the joint law of the directing measure and the
selected block is the disintegration `∫ δ_{P ω.1} ⊗ (P ω.1)^{⊗ Fin m}`.

This is the sharp conditional conclusion — the directing measure is pinned to the process, not
merely to the block laws — which is what makes `iidMixtureLaw` a realization of `P` as a directing
measure rather than only as a mixing representative. -/

# The conditional strong law of large numbers

A conditionally i.i.d. process obeys the strong law of large numbers **conditionally**: almost
surely, the averages of a bounded observable along the process converge to that observable's
integral against the *directing measure*, not against a deterministic law. Taking the observable to
be an indicator: for each *fixed* measurable set, the empirical frequency of that set converges
almost surely to the mass the directing measure gives it.

`ConditionallyIID/EmpiricalMeasure.lean` already gives the `L²` form of this, with the exact
finite-sample error. What is new here is almost-sure convergence, and the strengthening from a
single measurable set to a countable family of sets under one null set.

The quantifier order matters, and `∀ B, ∀ᵐ ω` is the strongest order available here: the null set
genuinely depends on the set tested. Setwise almost-sure convergence — one null set outside which
the empirical measures converge on *every* measurable set at once — is false as soon as the
directing measure is nonatomic, since the countable range of the sample path then carries empirical
mass `1` and directing mass `0`. Countability is exactly the room there is to improve the order,
and `tendsto_empiricalMeasure_apply_ae_forall` takes all of it.

## Main results

* `ConditionallyIIDWith.tendsto_average_ae` — the conditional strong law for a bounded measurable
  observable valued in a Banach space;
* `ConditionallyIIDWith.tendsto_integral_empiricalMeasure_ae` — its reading through
  `empiricalMeasure`;
* `ConditionallyIIDWith.tendsto_empiricalMeasure_apply_ae` and
  `ConditionallyIIDWith.tendsto_empiricalMeasure_apply_ae_forall` — the empirical frequencies, for
  one fixed measurable set and for a countable family of them under a single null set;

The de Finetti endpoint of these — the same statement for an *exchangeable* process, where the
directing measure has to be produced first — is `deFinetti_tendsto_empiricalMeasure_apply` in
`DeFinetti/EmpiricalMeasure.lean`. It is kept out of this module so that the conditional strong law
does not drag the de Finetti summit into every importer's closure.

## Implementation

The conditional statement is reduced to an unconditional one by the full-path joint disintegration
`ConditionallyIIDWith.jointPathLaw_eq_iidMixtureLaw`: the law of the pair `(ν, X)` on
`ProbabilityMeasure α × (ℕ → α)` is the mixture `∫ δ_Q ⊗ Q^{⊗ℕ} d(μ.map ν)(Q)`. The event

```text
G = {(Q, x) | the averages of `f` along `x` converge to `∫ f dQ`}
```

is measurable — `measurableSet_tendsto_fun`, using that `Q ↦ ∫ f dQ` is measurable, which is
Mathlib's `MeasureTheory.StronglyMeasurable.integral_kernel` for the coercion kernel
`ProbabilityMeasure α → Measure α` — and every fibre `δ_Q ⊗ Q^{⊗ℕ}` of the
mixture puts full mass on it, which is exactly `strong_law_ae_infinitePi` at the law `Q`. Mixing
over `Q` and transporting the resulting almost-sure statement back along `ω ↦ (ν ω, X · ω)` gives
the conditional strong law. No martingale or ergodic input is used: the joint disintegration
already carries all the conditional structure, and Mathlib's strong law does the analysis.

Boundedness of the observable is what makes the argument uniform in `Q`: it gives integrability
against *every* probability measure at once, and it is all the empirical-measure corollaries need.

## References

* Roadmap: `TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`, Layer 6's empirical form of the
  directing-measure theorem. This module supplies the topology-free fixed-set core; weak
  empirical-measure convergence is a separate downstream theorem requiring a chosen compatible
  Polish topology, which `[StandardBorelSpace α]` does not select. Such a theorem tests against a
  countable determining class, and `tendsto_empiricalMeasure_apply_ae_forall` is the "one null set
  for a countable determining class" step it consumes.

`tendsto_empiricalMeasure_apply_ae_forall` is as far as the quantifiers can be interchanged.

frequencies of *every* member of a countable family of measurable sets converge simultaneously.

Interchanging the two quantifiers is not cosmetic: an upgrade of setwise convergence to convergence
in the weak topology on `ProbabilityMeasure α` tests against a countable determining class, and
needs the null set to be chosen before the class is inspected. -/

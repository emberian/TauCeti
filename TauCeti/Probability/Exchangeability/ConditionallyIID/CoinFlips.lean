# Exchangeable coin flips: the worked example of a random bias

This file discharges the second worked example of the Exchangeability roadmap
(`TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`, "Worked examples"):

> A `Bool`-valued sequence generated conditionally i.i.d. given a random `θ` (draw `θ`, then flip
> i.i.d. `κ (θ ω)`-coins) is exchangeable, with `ω ↦ κ (θ ω)` (`κ` a two-point kernel) as the
> directing measure — genuinely: the generating construction makes it a witness of
> `ConditionallyIIDWith`, not merely a mixing representative.

The two-point kernel is `coinKernel p = Ber(true, false, p)`, Mathlib's `bernoulliMeasure` bundled
as a `ProbabilityMeasure Bool`; the parameter `θ` is the first coordinate of the canonical space
`I × (ℕ → Bool)` and the bias measure `π` is arbitrary. As the roadmap insists, the directing
measure is the *random probability measure* `ω ↦ coinKernel ω.1`, not the bias `ω ↦ ω.1` itself.

The example carries weight because the sequence is exchangeable without being independent:
`not_iIndepFun_coinFlips` exhibits a two-point bias law for which the coordinates are dependent, so
`ConditionallyIID` really is a wider class than i.i.d. and the constructed directing measure is not
a disguised constant.

## Main results

* `coinKernel` — the two-point kernel `p ↦ Ber(true, false, p)`, with `measurable_coinKernel` and
  the bias readout `coinKernel_apply_true`.
* `conditionallyIIDWith_coinFlips` — the coin-flip sequence is conditionally i.i.d. with directing
  measure `ω ↦ coinKernel ω.1`, hence `exchangeable_coinFlips` and `contractable_coinFlips`.
* `not_iIndepFun_coinFlips` — for a bias that is genuinely random the flips are *not* independent.

The construction it instantiates is `iidMixtureLaw` in
`TauCeti/Probability/Exchangeability/ConditionallyIID/Construct.lean`. Nothing here is adapted from
`cameronfreer/exchangeability`.

/-- **The two-point kernel.** `coinKernel p` is the law of one `Bool`-valued flip of a coin that
comes up `true` with probability `p`.

Phrasing the example through this kernel — rather than through a `Bernoulli` random variable —
keeps it independent of any particular parametrized-distribution API: all it needs is that the
family is measurable in the bias. -/

/-- **The worked example.** Draw a bias from `π`, then flip i.i.d. coins with that bias: the
resulting `Bool`-valued sequence is conditionally i.i.d. with directing measure
`ω ↦ coinKernel ω.1`.

This is the sharp conditional statement, not just the mixture identity: the generating construction
puts the sequence and its directing measure on one space and pins their joint law. -/

So `ConditionallyIID` is strictly wider than i.i.d., and the directing measure the construction
supplies is genuinely random rather than an a.e. constant. -/

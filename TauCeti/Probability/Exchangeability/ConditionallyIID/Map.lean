# Transferring conditional i.i.d.-ness along the path map

The canonical process on path space carries `ConditionallyIID` back to the original process.

## Main results

* `ConditionallyIIDWith.of_pathLaw` — the transfer at a named directing measure, identifying the
  transferred witness as `ν ∘ (ω ↦ fun i => X i ω)`.
* `conditionallyIID_of_conditionallyIID_pathLaw` — its existential corollary.

## Implementation

This is the conditional counterpart of `mixedIID_of_mixedIID_pathLaw`, and the roadmap refers to it
as `conditionallyIID_transfer`. Both sides of the disintegration identity move along the path map
`φ ω = fun i => X i ω`: the joint law by `Measure.map_map`, and the mixture by `bind_map`. The
directing measure transfers as `ν ∘ φ`.

Its purpose is to remove `[StandardBorelSpace Ω]` from statements proved on path space, which is
standard Borel whenever the state space is.

/-- **Path-law transfer, at a named directing measure.** If the coordinate process is conditionally
i.i.d. under the path law of `X` with directing measure `ν`, then `X` is conditionally i.i.d. with
directing measure `ν ∘ (ω ↦ fun i => X i ω)`.

Both sides of the disintegration identity move along the path map: the joint law by
`Measure.map_map`, the mixture by `bind_map`. -/

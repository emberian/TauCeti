# Conditionally i.i.d. families

The **conditional** strengthening of the mixture identity: a family is *conditionally i.i.d.*
with directing measure `ν` when, along every finite selection of distinct coordinates, the
**joint** law of `(ν, block)` is the disintegration `∫ δ_{ν ω} ⊗ (ν ω)^{⊗m} dμ(ω)` — conditionally
on `ν`, the block is i.i.d. `ν` (Kallenberg 2005, §1.1 eq. (2)).

Stating it as a joint-law identity means the definition needs no conditional expectations, and
sits in the same `bind`/`pi` vocabulary as `MixedIIDWith`.

## Why this is stronger than `MixedIIDWith`

`MixedIIDWith μ X ν` constrains only each block's **marginal** law. It therefore does not pin down
how `X` relates to `ν`: for a nondegenerate mixing law, an *independent copy* of a directing
measure also witnesses `MixedIIDWith`, while the process is not conditionally i.i.d. given that
copy. The arrow runs one way only, and `mixedIIDWith_of_conditionallyIIDWith` is that arrow —
obtained by integrating the `ν` coordinate out.

Terminology follows the roadmap: a `ν` witnessing only the mixture identity is a *mixing
representative*, whereas `ν` here is a genuine **directing measure**.

## Main results

* `ConditionallyIIDWith`, `ConditionallyIID` — the index-generic predicate and its existential
  wrapper, with their constructor, accessor, simp-normal-form, and injective-reindexing API.
* `mixedIIDWith_of_conditionallyIIDWith`, `mixedIID_of_conditionallyIID` — the easy projection down
  to the mixture identity. Both predicates are index-generic, so the projection is too.

This is a **Layer 0** contribution to `TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md` — the conditional
predicate for which the roadmap reserves the `ConditionallyIID` name, together with the easy
projection it pins alongside — which rests on the Layer 1 joint-kernel lemma
`measurable_dirac_prod_probabilityMeasure_pi_const_toMeasure`.

The Layer 1 joint-rectangle common ending `conditionallyIID_of_jointRectangles` lives in
`TauCeti.Probability.DeFinetti.ConditionalCommonEnding`. The Layer 6 summit theorems that conclude
this predicate, together with the `deFinetti*` equivalence handles, live in
`TauCeti.Probability.DeFinetti.Theorem`. A.e. uniqueness of the directing measure
(`conditionallyIID_ae_unique`) lives in
`TauCeti.Probability.Exchangeability.ConditionallyIID.Unique`.

/-- Conditional i.i.d.-ness with a specified directing measure `ν`: the random measure `ν` is
measurable, and along every finite selection `k` of **distinct** coordinates the *joint* law of
`(ν, block)` is the `ν`-disintegration `∫ δ_{ν ω} ⊗ (ν ω)^{⊗m} dμ(ω)`.

Constraining the joint law, rather than just the block's marginal, is exactly what makes this the
conditional statement: see `MixedIIDWith` for the marginal-only version and
`mixedIIDWith_of_conditionallyIIDWith` for the arrow between them. -/

/-- **The easy arrow.** A directing measure is in particular a mixing representative: the mixture
identity is the joint disintegration with the `ν` coordinate integrated out.

Taking the second marginal of both sides does exactly that. On the left, `Measure.snd_map_prodMk₀`
discards the `ν` coordinate needing only measurability of `ν` itself — which the predicate
supplies — so no hypothesis on the coordinates of `X` is required. On the right, naturality of
`bind` pushes the marginal inside the mixture, where each `δ_{ν ω}` factor integrates away. -/

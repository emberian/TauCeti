# Almost sure uniqueness of the directing measure

A **directing measure** — a witness of `ConditionallyIIDWith μ X ν` — is pinned down almost
everywhere: any two of them agree `μ`-a.e. This is the sharp uniqueness statement that the
mixture predicate `MixedIIDWith` fails to have, where only the *mixing law* `μ.map ν` is unique
(`mixedIID_mixingLaw_unique`); an independent copy of a directing measure is another mixing
representative but not another directing measure.

## Main results

* `conditionallyIID_ae_unique` — two directing measures of the same process are a.e. equal.
* `ConditionallyIIDWith.ae_measure_apply_eq` — the setwise form it is promoted from: on each fixed
  measurable set the two directing masses agree a.e.

The `L²` estimates driving both come from `ConditionallyIID/Moments.lean`; this file consumes them
and does no moment computation of its own.

## Implementation

The directing measure is recovered from the process by a law of large numbers, and the joint-law
form of `ConditionallyIIDWith` gives the second-moment version of that law directly, with no
conditional expectations. Writing `q ω = (ν ω) B` and `eᵢ` for the indicator of `Xᵢ ∈ B`, the
weighted block identity supplies the three moments

```text
∫ eᵢ = ∫ q,      ∫ eᵢ eⱼ = ∫ q²  (i ≠ j),      ∫ q eᵢ = ∫ q²,
```

the last of which is the genuinely *conditional* input: it is the joint law of `(ν, Xᵢ)`, not the
marginal law of `Xᵢ`, that the mixture predicate would leave free. The centred variables `eᵢ - q`
are therefore uncorrelated with common variance `∫ q - ∫ q²`, so the averages of `eᵢ` converge to
`q` with mean square error `O(1/n)`, hence in `L²` at rate `O(1/√n)`. Both directing measures are
approximated by the *same* averages, so the triangle inequality forces `∫ (q - q')² = 0` for every
measurable `B`, and a countable generating set algebra promotes that to a.e. equality of the random
measures themselves.

The hypothesis `[MeasurableSpace.CountablyGenerated α]` is what the final promotion needs, and is
all it needs: no measure on `α` is constructed here, so no standard-Borel or non-empty structure
is required.

The coordinates are only assumed a.e. measurable (`∀ i, AEMeasurable (X i) μ`), as elsewhere in the
measure-theoretic exchangeability API: every statement here sees `X` through integrals, hence only
modulo `μ`-a.e. equality.

directing measure is another mixing representative, and only the mixing law `μ.map ν` is determined
(`mixedIID_mixingLaw_unique`).

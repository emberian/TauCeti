# Exchangeable families

This file extends the sequence-level symmetry predicates to families indexed by an arbitrary type.
An `ExchangeableFamily` has the same law along any two finite injective selections of indices.
The existing `ConditionallyIIDWith` and `ConditionallyIID` predicates are already index-generic;
this file relates them to exchangeable families.

## Main results

* `exchangeableFamily_iff_exchangeable` identifies the family predicate over `ℕ` with the existing
  sequence predicate.
* `MixedIIDWith.exchangeableFamily` and `MixedIID.exchangeableFamily` give the easy implication
  from the mixture identity to exchangeability: along any two injective selections the block law is
  the same mixture of product measures.
* `ConditionallyIIDWith.exchangeableFamily` and `ConditionallyIID.exchangeableFamily` give the same
  implication for the conditional predicate, factored through the mixture one rather than proved
  again from the joint disintegration.
* `ExchangeableFamily.comp_injective` reindexes a family along an injection; the corresponding
  conditional i.i.d. lemmas are in `ConditionallyIID.Basic`.

This is the family exchangeability API needed for the Layer 8 target “de Finetti for other
countable index types” in `TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`. The countable-index theorem
itself is in `TauCeti.Probability.DeFinetti.CountableIndex`.

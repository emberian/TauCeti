# An i.i.d. sequence is mixed i.i.d., exchangeable, and contractable

This file discharges the first worked example of the Exchangeability roadmap
(`TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`, "Worked examples"):

> The law of an i.i.d. sequence is `MixedIID`, `Exchangeable`, and `Contractable`.

For a sequence `X : ℕ → Ω → α` on a probability space whose coordinates are independent
(`ProbabilityTheory.iIndepFun X μ`) and identically distributed
(`∀ i, IdentDistrib (X i) (X 0) μ μ`), the constant random measure `ω ↦ law of X 0` is a
mixing representative: `MixedIIDWith.of_iIndepFun_identDistrib`. Exchangeability and
contractability then follow from the Layer 0 implications
`MixedIIDWith.exchangeable` and `MixedIIDWith.contractable`.

Only the *conclusions* `Exchangeable` and `Contractable` need `ℕ`. The mixed-i.i.d. results hold
for a family over an arbitrary index type: `MixedIIDWith.of_iIndepFun_map_eq` takes the common law
as a parameter, and `MixedIIDWith.of_iIndepFun_identDistrib_at` takes a caller-supplied reference
coordinate in place of `0`. The unsuffixed `of_iIndepFun_identDistrib` forms are their `ℕ`
specializations.

The mathematical content is the block-law identity: along an injective selection
`k : Fin m → ℕ` the coordinates `X ∘ k` are independent (a subfamily of an independent
family, `ProbabilityTheory.iIndepFun.precomp`) with common law `μ.map (X 0)`, so their joint
law is the `m`-fold product `Measure.pi (fun _ => μ.map (X 0))`
(`ProbabilityTheory.iIndepFun.map_fun_eq_pi_map`); this is exactly the value of the mixture
against a constant mixing representative. The example validates the Layer 0 mixed-i.i.d.
API on the canonical i.i.d. case and needs no material from
`cameronfreer/exchangeability`.

The roadmap's worked-example entry also asks for the sharper statement that an i.i.d. sequence is
genuinely `ConditionallyIID`, with this constant measure as its *directing measure*. That is
`TauCeti.Probability.ConditionallyIIDWith.of_iIndepFun_identDistrib`, in
`TauCeti/Probability/Exchangeability/ConditionallyIID/Const.lean`, which upgrades the mixture form
below; the same file records that a constant witness makes the two predicates equivalent.

/-- **Independent, identically distributed coordinates are mixed i.i.d.**, at an arbitrary index
type, with the common law `μ.map (X i₀)` as constant mixing representative.

`i₀` is a caller-supplied reference coordinate: an abstract index type provides none, and
`IdentDistrib` needs one to compare against. `MixedIIDWith.of_iIndepFun_map_eq` avoids it entirely
by naming the law instead, and is the better entry point when the law is already known. -/

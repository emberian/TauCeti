# Bounded observables of contractable processes in L²

This file supplies the bounded-observable entry point to the L² lane of the Exchangeability
roadmap.  Applying a measurable real-valued observable coordinatewise to a contractable process
preserves contractability, so whenever the mapped coordinates are square-integrable the process
inherits the uniform covariance structure of
`TauCeti.Probability.Exchangeability.L2.Covariance`: the means agree across all coordinates, so do
the variances, and every off-diagonal covariance takes a single common value.

* `Contractable.covariance_structure_comp` records this for any observable whose coordinates lie in
  L².
* `Contractable.covariance_structure_comp_of_bound` specializes it to a bounded observable, whose
  coordinates are square-integrable automatically on a finite measure space.

The bounded case discharges the worked-example check in `TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`,
"In the real-valued L² lane, bounded observables give `MemLp 2` automatically."  Credit for the
reused material goes to the Tau Ceti covariance and map APIs; no material from
`cameronfreer/exchangeability` is used.

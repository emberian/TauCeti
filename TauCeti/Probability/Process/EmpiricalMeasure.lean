# Empirical measures of sequences

This file defines the empirical probability measure of the first `n + 1` terms of a sequence and
gives its basic evaluation, integration, and measurability API.  The successor indexing makes the
object a probability measure without a nonemptiness side condition and matches the form used in
limit theorems.

The construction is a uniform finite sum of Dirac measures.  It is the process-level prerequisite
for the empirical-measure form of de Finetti's theorem in the `Exchangeability` roadmap.

# Block averages of a real-valued process

The empirical mean of a process over a finite selection of coordinates, with its elementary
algebra. Nothing here involves a measure: `blockAverage X k` is a function of `ω`, and the three
lemmas below are the pointwise formula, the scaled-sum normal form, and the value on a constant
block. `average_sub_sq_eq_sum_sum` records the one further piece of average algebra used
downstream: the square of a deviation from an average, expanded as a double sum.
`birkhoffAverage_eq_prefixAverage` identifies a Birkhoff average of an arbitrary self-map with a
prefix average of the iterated observable, which is how Mathlib's mean-ergodic theory reaches this
API; it is stated for an arbitrary self-map because no dynamical content enters — both sides are
the same normalised sum.

It also carries the standard selections, all measure-free. `prefixAverage X n` averages the first
`n` coordinates and `followingAverage X n` the `n` after them, with their pointwise formulas.

`fixedStart r` is the same fixed-start window in *moving-selection* form — a family
`∀ n, Fin (n + 1) → ℕ` rather than a single block — which is the shape the `L²` convergence
theorems quantify over. It belongs here because it is a generic block selection with no disjointness
content; the disjoint windows those theorems also accept are `disjointWindow` in
`Process/DisjointWindow.lean`. `fixedStart_injective` gives injectivity at each length and
`fixedStart_eventually_injective` the eventual form the limit theorems take.

Measure-theoretic facts about all three — square-integrability, conditional expectations, variances
and covariances under contractability — live with the `L²` averaging library in
`Exchangeability/L2/BlockAverages.lean` and `Exchangeability/L2/LongTailAverages.lean`, which import
this module. Keeping the definitions here means a route that only needs the algebra does not import
the `L²` machinery to get them: the Koopman route needs `prefixAverage` to state its Birkhoff
bridge, and has no `L²` content of its own.

/-! ### The unit interval

A block average of `[0,1]`-valued coordinates stays in `[0,1]`. This is the bound the product
convergence lemmas need, and it is pure order algebra — no measure and no norm is involved, so the
`‖·‖ ≤ 1` form is left to the consumer that has a normed structure in scope. -/

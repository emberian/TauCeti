# `L²` membership of the Hermite polynomials against a Gaussian measure

This file specializes the generic Gaussian/polynomial `L²` membership of
`TauCeti.Probability.Distributions.Gaussian.PolynomialMemLp` to the probabilists' Hermite
polynomials `Polynomial.hermite n`.  The Hermite statement `memLp_hermite_gaussianReal` is target
**A3′** of the `OrthogonalL2Bases` roadmap: the variance-general `L²` membership of the normalized
Hermite polynomials `Hₙ / √(n!)` under `gaussianReal 0 v`, the membership the Gaussian Hermite
Hilbert-basis construction consumes for its `MemLp` obligations.

The scalar-generic cast to `[RCLike 𝕜]` (needed because the roadmap's bases are stated over
`Lp 𝕜 2 μ` uniformly for `𝕜 = ℝ` and `𝕜 = ℂ`) reuses Mathlib's `MemLp.ofReal`, rewriting the
`algebraMap ℝ 𝕜` cast to `RCLike.ofReal`.

The `Polynomial` evaluation API and `MemLp.ofReal` are consumed, not re-derived.

polynomial `Hₙ / √(n!)`, cast into `𝕜`, is square-integrable against every centred real Gaussian

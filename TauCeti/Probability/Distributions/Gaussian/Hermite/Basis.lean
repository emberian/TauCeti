# The Hermite polynomials as a Hilbert basis of `L²(γ)`

Roadmap milestone **A3′**: the measure-side one-dimensional Gaussian Hermite basis. Where
`TauCeti.hermiteHilbertBasis` puts the Gaussian envelope inside the *function* (`ψₙ` in `L²(ℝ)`),
this puts it in the *measure*: `Hₙ/√(n!)` is an orthonormal basis of `L²(γ)` for the standard
Gaussian `γ = gaussianReal 0 1`.

That is the form multivariate Gaussian `L²` and chaos expansions consume, and it is the input
`piHilbertBasis` needs for the multidimensional basis of Part D.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.integral_hermite_mul_hermite_mul_gaussianPDFReal` — the orthogonality relation against
  the standard Gaussian density, with normalization `cₙ = n!`.
* `TauCeti.integrable_exp_mul_abs_gaussianPDFReal` — the standard Gaussian density has every
  exponential moment finite, the hypothesis
  `TauCeti.orthogonal_span_range_bareNormalizedLp_eq_bot` needs.
* `TauCeti.gaussianHermiteHilbertBasis` — milestone A3′ itself.
* `TauCeti.coeFn_gaussianHermiteHilbertBasis` — the anti-vacuity pin: the basis vectors really are
  `Hₙ/√(n!)`, not merely *some* orthonormal basis.
* `TauCeti.sqrt_gaussianPDFReal_mul_hermiteℝ_div_sqrt_factorial` — the `√w`-envelope of a basis
  vector is `2^{-1/4}·ψₙ(x/√2)`, identifying this basis with the function-side
  `TauCeti.hermiteHilbertBasis` through `TauCeti.weightL2Isometry`.
* `TauCeti.sqrt_gaussianPDFReal_smul_gaussianHermiteHilbertBasis` — that envelope computed on the
  public basis vector itself, a.e. against `volume`.
* `TauCeti.weightL2Isometry_gaussianHermiteHilbertBasis` — the same identification at the
  `TauCeti.weightL2Isometry` level: the image of the `n`-th basis vector is `2^{-1/4} • ψₙ(·/√2)`.

/-- **Orthogonality against the standard Gaussian density.**
`∫ Hₘ Hₙ dγ = δₘₙ · n!`. This is the density-side reading of the Gaussian-measure orthogonality
milestone `TauCeti.integral_hermite_mul_hermite_gaussianReal`: `∫ · ∂γ` unfolds to `∫ pdf • ·`, so
the two differ only by the order of the factors. -/

/-! ## The weighted-measure input data

`TauCeti.hermiteℝ` and its `eval`/`degree` lemmas live in
`TauCeti/RingTheory/Polynomial/Hermite/Real.lean`: they mention no measure and no Gaussian, and
keeping them here would strand them below the function-side files that use the same cast. -/

/-- **Finite exponential moments of the standard Gaussian.** For every rate `a`, `e^{a|x|}` is
integrable against `γ`.

Both one-sided exponentials are already integrable against a Gaussian
(`ProbabilityTheory.integrable_exp_mul_gaussianReal`, which is the mgf being everywhere finite), and
`ProbabilityTheory.integrable_exp_mul_abs` folds the rates `a` and `-a` into the two-sided
`e^{a|x|}`. Transporting along `ProbabilityTheory.gaussianReal_of_var_ne_zero` then puts it in the
with-density form the completeness theorem takes; the `ENNReal.ofReal ∘ gaussianPDFReal` spelling
of the density is definitionally the `gaussianPDF` that lemma produces. -/

/-- **The Gaussian envelope carries `Hₙ/√(n!)` to a dilated Hermite function.**

inside `Real.sqrt`.

Multiplication by `√w` is exactly `TauCeti.weightL2Isometry`, so this is the pointwise
characterization of that isometry's image on `TauCeti.gaussianHermiteHilbertBasis`: it pins the
measure-side basis of `L²(γ)` to the function-side basis `TauCeti.hermiteHilbertBasis` of `L²(ℝ)`,
up to the dilation `x ↦ x/√2` and that normalization. Without it a consumer moving between the two
normalizations has to redo the dilation and normalization bookkeeping. -/

/-- **The Gaussian envelope of the basis is the dilated Hermite function family.** Scaling the
`n`-th basis vector of `L²(γ)` by `√(γ-density)` gives `2^{-1/4} • ψₙ(·/√2)`.

Stated a.e. against `volume`, the measure that envelope lives on, and in terms of the public
`gaussianHermiteHilbertBasis` rather than its weighted-measure preimage. The pointwise content is
`TauCeti.sqrt_gaussianPDFReal_mul_hermiteℝ_div_sqrt_factorial`; the only work here is moving the
basis representative from `γ`-a.e. to `volume`-a.e., which is legitimate because the Gaussian
density never vanishes.

`√w`-scaling is the forward map of `TauCeti.weightL2Isometry`, so this is the pointwise content of
`TauCeti.weightL2Isometry_gaussianHermiteHilbertBasis` below, which states the same fact at the
isometry level. -/

/-- **The `weightL2Isometry`-image of the Gaussian Hermite basis is the dilated Hermite function

to the function-side basis `TauCeti.hermiteHilbertBasis` of `L²(ℝ)` up to that dilation and
normalization.

`TauCeti.weightL2Isometry` has `L²(volume.withDensity …)` as its domain, whereas
`TauCeti.gaussianHermiteHilbertBasis` lives in the propositionally equal `L²(γ)`, so the basis
vector is transported along that equality of measures before the isometry is applied. The weight is
the fixed function `gaussianPDFReal 0 1`, whose positivity and measurability are supplied here
rather than left to the caller; by proof irrelevance this still applies to
`TauCeti.weightL2Isometry` built from any other proofs of those two side conditions. -/

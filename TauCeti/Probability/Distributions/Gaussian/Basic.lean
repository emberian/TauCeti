# Closed forms for the real Gaussian density

Mathlib's `ProbabilityTheory.gaussianPDFReal μ v` is stated for a general mean `μ` and variance `v`.
This file records the specialization at the standard parameters `μ = 0`, `v = 1`, where the shift
and the variance both disappear and the density collapses to `(√(2π))⁻¹ · e^{-x²/2}`.

That closed form is what any calculation against the standard Gaussian weight rewrites by, and it
is a statement about the Gaussian distribution alone: it mentions no orthogonal family, so it
belongs here rather than in any of the families that consume it (the Hermite orthogonality
relation and the Gaussian Hermite basis both do).

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.gaussianPDFReal_zero_one` — `gaussianPDFReal 0 1 x = (√(2π))⁻¹ · e^{-x²/2}`.

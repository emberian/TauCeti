# Vanishing moments force a function to be zero

Roadmap milestone **B1** of the `OrthogonalL2Bases` roadmap, in both the forms the completeness
step uses.  `TauCeti.Probability.Moments.Determinacy` pins down a *measure* from its moments; this
file transfers that to *functions*.

Both forms assume exponential control at a single positive rate; they differ in what carries it.

* `TauCeti.ae_eq_zero_of_forall_moment_eq_zero` (function level) assumes the *product*
  `e^{a|x|} · g` is integrable for some `a > 0`, and concludes for a real `g`.
* `TauCeti.ae_eq_zero_of_forall_moment_eq_zero_of_exists_integrable_exp` (measure level) assumes
  it of the *weight* alone -- `e^{a|x|} ∈ L¹(ν)` for some `a > 0` -- and of `g` only that it lies
  in `L²(ν)`, for scalars in any `RCLike` field.  Cauchy-Schwarz bridges the two.  The roadmap name
  `ae_eq_zero_of_forall_moment_eq_zero_of_finite_expMoments`, taking the stronger *all-rates*
  hypothesis its name implies, is provided as a public wrapper.

The measure-level form is the usable one: `hexp` becomes a statement about the weight alone
(Gaussian decay, or automatic for a *finite* compactly supported measure), independent of `g`.
Compact support alone does not suffice: on a compactly supported measure of infinite mass even the
constant `1` fails to be integrable.  In the measure-level form finiteness of `ν` is not a separate
hypothesis: there `hexp` integrates the weight `e^{a|x|} ≥ 1` itself, which dominates the constant
`1`.  The function-level form carries no such implication -- its `hexp` integrates the *product*
`e^{a|x|} · g`, which `g = 0` satisfies over any measure, finite or infinite.

The same exponential-moment hypothesis also makes every polynomial moment finite, so the result
that records this -- `TauCeti.integrable_pow_of_exp_moment`, a symmetric-moment adaptation of
`ProbabilityTheory.integrable_pow_of_integrable_exp_mul` -- lives here with it rather than with
any one consumer.

/-! ## Exponential moments control polynomial moments -/

/-- **One finite exponential moment makes every polynomial moment finite.**

The two-sided moment hypothesis of `ProbabilityTheory.integrable_pow_of_integrable_exp_mul` is
what a *single* symmetric moment `e^{a|x|} ∈ L¹(ν)` supplies: `±x ≤ |x|` makes `e^{a|x|}`
dominate both `e^{ax}` and `e^{-ax}`.

This is the bridge to the family-agnostic polynomial interface of
`TauCeti.MeasureTheory.Function.PolynomialMemLp`, whose hypothesis is exactly "every polynomial
moment is finite"; the `MemLp` statements of
`TauCeti.Analysis.InnerProductSpace.PolynomialCompleteness` are that interface applied through
this. -/

/-- **Roadmap B1 (function level).** A real function on `ℝ` whose exponentially-weighted product
`e^{a|x|} · g` is integrable for some `a > 0`, and all of whose polynomial moments `∫ xⁿ g` vanish,
is a.e. zero.

This is the internal transfer step, not the form the completeness step consumes — that is the
measure-level `ae_eq_zero_of_forall_moment_eq_zero_of_exists_integrable_exp` below, which wraps this
one. `Measure.ext_of_forall_integral_pow_eq_of_exists_integrable_exp` in
`TauCeti.Probability.Moments.Determinacy` pins down a *measure* from its moments, and this transfers
that to a *function* by applying it to the positive and negative parts of `g` as densities
against `ν`.

The exponential hypothesis is the existential `∃ a > 0`, matching the engine's convention; a caller
holding a bound at every rate supplies it at any single one.

The reference measure is arbitrary, not just `volume`, and carries no σ-finiteness hypothesis: the
argument splits `g` into `g⁺`/`g⁻` as densities, and integrability of `g` already bounds the
positive density's lintegral, which is what lets equality of the two `withDensity` measures be read
back as equality of the densities. That generality is what lets weighted orthogonal families against
a measure other than Lebesgue (Hermite against a Gaussian, Chebyshev against `(1-x²)^{-1/2}` on
`[-1,1]`) reach the completeness step, through the measure-level form below. -/

/-- **Roadmap B1, measure level.** A measure `ν` on `ℝ` carrying one finite exponential moment is
moment-determinate, so a `g ∈ L²(ν)` orthogonal to every monomial is a.e. `0`.

The rate is existential, matching the convention of the engine this wraps and of the function-level
form above; a caller holding a bound at every rate supplies it at any single one.  Requiring it at
*every* rate would exclude exponentially-tailed weights such as `e^{-|x|}`, for which
`∫ e^{a|x|} dν` is finite only for `a < 1`, even though they are moment-determinate all the same.
The `_of_exists_integrable_exp` suffix names the hypothesis exactly — *existence* of one positive
rate with `e^{a|x|}` integrable — and matches the adjacent determinacy API
(`Measure.ext_of_forall_integral_pow_eq_of_exists_integrable_exp`).  The roadmap name
`_of_finite_expMoments`, with the matching *all-rates* hypothesis, wraps this one immediately below.

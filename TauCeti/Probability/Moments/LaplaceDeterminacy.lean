# A finite measure on `ℝ≥0` is determined by its Laplace transform

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Measure.ext_of_forall_integral_exp_neg_natCast_mul_eq` — the sharp form: the transform's
  values at the natural numbers already determine the measure.
* `TauCeti.Measure.ext_of_forall_integral_exp_neg_mul_eq` — the convenience form, hypothesis at
  every nonnegative real.

## Implementation

The substitution `y = e^{-x}` converts the Laplace transform into a moment sequence: at a natural
argument `n`, `∫ e^{-n x} dμ = ∫ yⁿ d(μ.map (x ↦ e^{-x}))`. So matching Laplace transforms give
pushforwards with matching moments, and the pushforwards are moment-determinate because they are
carried by `(0, 1]` — bounded support makes the exponential-moment hypothesis of
`Measure.ext_of_forall_integral_pow_eq_of_exists_integrable_exp` automatic. Finally `x ↦ e^{-x}` is
injective and measurable between standard Borel spaces, hence a measurable embedding by
Lusin–Souslin, and `MeasurableEmbedding.map_injective` recovers `μ = ν` from the equal pushforwards.

Only the transform's values at *natural* arguments are used, which is why the primary statement
quantifies over `ℕ`; the real-argument form is a one-line corollary for callers that have it.

This is the uniqueness half of the Bernstein milestone in
`TauCetiRoadmap/OneParameterSemigroups/README.md`, Part B. The existence half is a separate,
independent development, and the two are combined in the Hausdorff--Bernstein--Widder theorem
(`TauCeti.hausdorff_bernstein_widder_existsUnique` in
`Analysis/CompletelyMonotone/Bernstein/HausdorffBernsteinWidder.lean`).
Nothing here mentions complete monotonicity — the statement is about two arbitrary
finite measures — which is why it lives beside the other determinacy results rather than under
`Analysis/CompletelyMonotone/`.

# The rectangle common ending for de Finetti

This file provides the first shared de Finetti common-ending adapter.  If a measurable random
probability measure `ν : Ω → ProbabilityMeasure α` has the expected rectangle factorization for
every finite injective block of a family, then the family is `MixedIID`.

The work is done by the `MixedIIDWith` rectangle characterization
(`mixedIIDWith_of_forall_rectangles`, next to its definition): rectangles generate the
finite product σ-algebra by Mathlib's `generateFrom_pi` / `isPiSystem_pi`, and Tau Ceti's
product-kernel API evaluates the mixture on rectangles.  This file packages that as the existential
wrapper.  This advances `TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`, Layer 1, the mixture common
de Finetti ending `mixedIID_of_mixingRepresentative`. The joint-rectangle strengthening
`conditionallyIID_of_jointRectangles`, which the roadmap pairs with it, lives in
`TauCeti.Probability.DeFinetti.ConditionalCommonEnding`.

This is adapted from the rectangle common-ending strategy in
`cameronfreer/exchangeability` (`DeFinetti/CommonEnding.lean`, pin
`e0532e59ceff23edab44dda9ab0655debbc9cc22`), but stated over Tau Ceti's current
`MixedIIDWith` and `ProbabilityMeasure.pi` APIs.

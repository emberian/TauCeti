# The de Finetti measure

The law of the canonical directing measure, as a probability measure on `ProbabilityMeasure α`,
together with the specialization of the mixture representation to it.

## Main results

* `deFinettiMeasure` — the law of `directingProbabilityMeasure`, bundled as a
  `ProbabilityMeasure (ProbabilityMeasure α)`, with `deFinettiMeasure_toMeasure` exposing its
  underlying measure.
* `pathLaw_eq_bind_infinitePi_deFinettiMeasure_of_mixedIIDWith` — the mixture representation against
  it, for a process whose canonical directing measure is a mixing representative.

## Hypotheses

The generic representation `pathLaw_eq_bind_infinitePi_of_mixedIIDWith` needs only
`[IsFiniteMeasure μ]`, a.e.-measurable coordinates, and a witness. The definition here needs more,
because the canonical directing measure is built from a conditional distribution: a probability base
law `[IsProbabilityMeasure μ]`, a standard-Borel nonempty **state** space
`[StandardBorelSpace α] [Nonempty α]`, and enough measurability to place the directing map in the
ambient σ-algebra — which is exactly `tailProcess X ≤ ‹MeasurableSpace Ω›`, taken as an argument
rather than the stronger pointwise measurability of the coordinates. The specialization derives that
bound from measurable coordinates via `tailProcess_le_ambient`.

No theorem here assumes `[StandardBorelSpace Ω]`. That hypothesis is what *supplying* the canonical
witness costs — `mixedIIDWith_of_contractable` carries it — so the specialization below takes the
witness as an explicit hypothesis instead of deriving it.

## Final representation

The Layer 6 bullet in `TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md` asks for the mixture form with `π`
the **unique** law of `ν`. That uniqueness is `mixedIID_mixingLaw_unique`, proved alongside the
generic representation in `Exchangeability/MixedIID/Mixture.lean`; it is stated for `MixedIIDWith`
witnesses and so does not mention `deFinettiMeasure`. The theorem `deFinetti_mixture` in
`TauCeti.Probability.DeFinetti.Representation` derives the unique mixing-law representation from
exchangeability without assuming a witness.

/-- The law of the canonical directing measure `directingProbabilityMeasure μ X`, as a probability
measure on `ProbabilityMeasure α`.

This is the **de Finetti measure** — the mixing law `π` of the de Finetti representation —
*precisely when* `directingProbabilityMeasure μ X` is a `MixedIIDWith` witness for `X`, which is
what `pathLaw_eq_bind_infinitePi_deFinettiMeasure_of_mixedIIDWith` assumes. The definition itself
assumes no exchangeability or contractability, so for a general measurable process it is just that
pushforward and need not represent the path law at all.

Bundling records at the type level that the mixing law is a probability measure, and supports the
downstream weak-topology and convergence APIs, which are stated for `ProbabilityMeasure`; it coerces
back to `Measure` for the `bind` representation. Bundling is also why measurability is required at
construction time, as the argument `hTail`: `Measure.map` of a non-measurable function is `0`, which
is not a probability measure, so the pushforward is not known to be one without it. The bound
`tailProcess X ≤ ‹MeasurableSpace Ω›` is all that is needed — the directing map is tail-measurable
by construction — so this is weaker than assuming the coordinates measurable. -/

/-- **The mixture representation against the de Finetti measure.** When the canonical directing
measure is a mixing representative for `X`, the path law of `X` is the `deFinettiMeasure`-mixture of
the infinite product measures.

The witness hypothesis is taken rather than derived: `mixedIIDWith_of_contractable` supplies it, but
only under `[StandardBorelSpace Ω]`, and taking it here keeps that assumption out of this
statement. -/

# Factorizing a whole block over an invariant event

Iterating the one-coordinate decoupling across a block of length `r`.

The inductive step takes a block of length `r + 1` and peels its last coordinate, replacing
`𝟙_{B_r}(x_r)` — the factor at index `Fin.last r` — by its conditional expectation given the
shift-invariant σ-algebra, leaving a block of length `r`. The factors already peeled do not vanish:
they accumulate as an invariants-measurable weight, which is exactly what the weighted decoupling
chain carries.

## Main results

All three in the `ContractableLaw` namespace:

* `setIntegral_weight_mul_blockIndicatorProd_prefix_eq_prod_condExp` — the induction, in
  conditional-expectation form, against an invariants-measurable weight;
* `setIntegral_weight_mul_blockIndicatorProd_prefix_eq_prod_invariantConditionalProbabilityMeasure`
  — the same with each conditional expectation replaced by the invariant conditional law it
  computes;
* `setIntegral_blockIndicatorProd_prefix_eq_prod_invariantConditionalProbabilityMeasure`
  — its `w = 1` specialisation, which is the form a cylinder-mass computation consumes.

## Why the conditional expectation, not the witness

The induction carries its accumulated factors as the *weight* of the next step, and the weighted
transport demands a weight that is strictly measurable for `MeasurableSpace.invariants (shift α)`.
A conditional expectation is, by `stronglyMeasurable_condExp`. The invariant conditional law `ν(B)`
is only characterised up to a null set, so it cannot serve. Conversion happens once, at the end.

Everything stays in `ℝ`; the crossing to `ℝ≥0∞` belongs to the common ending, not here.

## Relation to the other `BlockFactorization` files

`DeFinetti/BlockFactorization.lean` and `DeFinetti/ViaL2/BlockFactorization.lean` prove the
corresponding step for the martingale and `L²` routes, conditioning on the tail rather than on the
shift-invariant σ-algebra. Nothing is shared: the two σ-algebras can differ, with
`invariants_shift_lt_pathTail` witnessing strictness over `Bool`-valued paths, and this file
imports neither.

## Source

The Koopman route follows Kallenberg's first proof (see References). No material is adapted from
`cameronfreer/exchangeability`; the induction here is assembled from this repository's own weighted
decoupling chain in `ViaKoopman/Decoupling.lean`.

/-- **A block factorizes over an invariant event**, in conditional-expectation form.

Peeling the last coordinate replaces `𝟙_{B_r}(x_r)` by its conditional expectation given the
shift-invariant σ-algebra; the factors already peeled ride along as the weight of the next step,
which is why the whole chain is stated against one. -/

# Simultaneous convergence of a product of indicator block averages

For a contractable process on a standard Borel state space, the block averages of finitely many
indicators over **pairwise disjoint** windows converge in `L¹`, simultaneously, to the product of
the corresponding directing-measure evaluations:

```text
∫ |∏ i, blockAverage 𝟙_{B i} (window (n+1) i) - ∏ i, (directingMeasure ω).real (B i)| dμ → 0.
```

The selections are `disjointWindow i`, so factor `i` occupies `[(i+1)(n+1), (i+2)(n+1))`. Distinct
factors never collide (`disjointWindow_ne`), and the windows move outward as the length grows —
which is exactly what fixed starts cannot do, since windows from distinct fixed starts overlap once
the common length exceeds the gap between the starts.

Two ingredients meet here.

*Each factor converges.* The indicator-to-directing-measure convergence in
`ViaL2/EmpiricalToDirecting.lean` accepts any eventually-injective moving selection. The general
theorem below therefore takes an arbitrary family of such selections; cross-factor disjointness is
not needed for the convergence, only for what the terms mean downstream. The limit does not
depend on the selection,
so all `m` factors converge to their directing-measure evaluations against the *same* directing
measure.

*The product follows.* `tendsto_integral_norm_prod_sub_prod` turns finitely many `L¹`
convergences into convergence of the product, and indicators supply the unit-ball bounds it needs
on both sides.

## References

* Roadmap: `TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`, **Layer 3** — the simultaneous
  disjoint-window product convergence that the finite-block conditional factorization consumes.

/-- **Simultaneous convergence of a product of indicator block averages.** For a contractable
process on a standard Borel state space and finitely many measurable sets `B i`, each read along
its own selection `k i`, the product of the block averages converges in `L¹` to the product of the
directing-measure evaluations.

Only each selection's own eventual injectivity is used; nothing here needs the selections to be
disjoint from one another. Disjointness matters for what the *terms* mean downstream, not for the
convergence. -/

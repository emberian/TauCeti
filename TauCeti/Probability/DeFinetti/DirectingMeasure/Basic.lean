# The de Finetti directing measure

For a process `X : ℕ → Ω → α` valued in a standard Borel space `α`, `directingMeasure μ X ω` is the
conditional law of the initial coordinate `X 0` given the process tail σ-algebra `tailProcess X`,
realised as Mathlib's regular conditional distribution `condDistrib` of `X 0`, conditioning on
`tailProcess X` via the identity map:

```
directingMeasure μ X ω = condDistrib (X 0) (id) μ ω    (conditioning on tailProcess X).
```

Because it lives over the **value** space `α`, it needs only `[StandardBorelSpace α]` (and
`[Nonempty α]`); the sample space `Ω` is an arbitrary measurable space.

This is the tail-conditioned directing measure: the object the martingale route proves to be a
`ConditionallyIIDWith` witness, and the one any route conditioning on `tailProcess X` will use. A
route conditioning on a different σ-algebra builds its own conditional law — see
`DeFinetti.ViaKoopman.InvariantConditionalLaw` for the shift-invariant one, which
`ContractableLaw.conditionallyIIDWith_invariantConditionalProbabilityMeasure` proves is a witness in
its own right — and whether two such objects agree a.e. is a theorem about them, not a property of
this file.

This file records the basic theory: it is a probability measure
(`isProbabilityMeasure_directingMeasure`), its set evaluations are `tailProcess X`-measurable
(`measurable_tailProcess_directingMeasure_coe`, with the ambient corollary
`measurable_directingMeasure_coe`), and it is the conditional law of `X 0` given the tail
(`directingMeasure_ae_eq_condExp`). It is also bundled as the `ProbabilityMeasure`-valued
`directingProbabilityMeasure`, measurable at the `tailProcess X` level
(`measurable_tailProcess_directingProbabilityMeasure`, with the ambient corollary
`measurable_directingProbabilityMeasure`) — the form `MixedIIDWith` consumes as its witness `ν`.
The block-product factorisation (conditional independence across a whole block) is a separate
concern and lives with the routes that establish it.

Adapted from `cameronfreer/exchangeability` (`DeFinetti/ViaMartingale/DirectingMeasure.lean`, pin
`e0532e59ceff23edab44dda9ab0655debbc9cc22`); that version conditions over `Ω` (needing
`[StandardBorelSpace Ω]`), here strengthened to the value-space formulation over Mathlib's
`condDistrib` and the Tau Ceti `tailProcess` API.

/-- The **de Finetti directing measure**: the conditional law of the initial coordinate `X 0` given
the process tail σ-algebra `tailProcess X`, as the regular conditional distribution of `X 0` given
that σ-algebra (Mathlib's `condDistrib`, conditioning on `tailProcess X` via the identity map). It
lives over the value space `α`, so it needs `α` standard Borel, not `Ω`. -/
-- `directingMeasure` is intentionally opaque (no `@[expose]`): downstream code uses the
-- characteristic lemmas below (probability measure, `tailProcess`-measurability,
-- `directingMeasure_ae_eq_condExp`) rather than the definition body. A public `rfl`-unfold lemma is
-- incompatible with hiding the body (an exported unfold would require `@[expose]`), so the

# The directing measure is the conditional law of every coordinate

`directingMeasure_ae_eq_condExp` (in `DirectingMeasure/Basic.lean`) identifies the directing
measure with the conditional law of the initial coordinate `X 0` given the tail σ-algebra. For
a **contractable** process the same holds for every coordinate.
`Contractable.directingMeasure_ae_eq_condExp_coord` promotes that identity from `X 0` to every
`X m`, using the "extreme members agree on the tail" collapse
`Contractable.condExp_indicator_tailProcess_eq`.

This is the per-coordinate input to the de Finetti block-product factorisation: it is what lets the
single directing measure serve as the common conditional law of all coordinates.

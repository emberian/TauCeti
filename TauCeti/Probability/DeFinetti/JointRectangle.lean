# The conditional summit from contractability

A contractable process valued in a nonempty standard Borel space is **conditionally i.i.d.**: there
is a directing measure given which every finite distinct block is i.i.d., as a joint-law
disintegration.

## Main results

* `conditionallyIIDWith_of_contractable_pathSpace` — the summit on path space, at the canonical
  directing measure. `DeFinetti/Theorem.lean` derives the sample-space form from it.

## Implementation

The predicate `ConditionallyIIDWith` asks for a joint-law identity, so the block identities of the
mixture route are not enough: the directing measure must survive alongside the block. Three layers
supply that, all private.

**The set-integral identity.** The mass on the tail event `ν ⁻¹' S` meeting a *prefix* block
cylinder is the integral of the directing-measure product over that event. Since `ν` is
`tailProcess`-measurable, `ν ⁻¹' S` is a tail event, so `setIntegral_condExp` may be tested against
it and the prefix factorization replaces the conditional expectation. The real/`ℝ≥0∞` conversion it
runs on is `DirectingMeasure/Integral.lean`, shared with `BlockFactorization`.

**Symmetry transport.** A finitely supported permutation realising an injective selection on the
initial segment carries the prefix identity to that selection. It fixes `ν`, because tail events lie
in the exchangeable σ-algebra, and it preserves the measure, because contractability gives
exchangeability — so the directing-measure event rides along untouched. This needs no sorting of the
selection: the permutation realises arbitrary injective selections directly.

**Path space.** Both of the above run on `ℕ → α`, which is standard Borel whenever `α` is. That is
what keeps `[StandardBorelSpace Ω]` out of the exported statement:
`conditionallyIID_of_conditionallyIID_pathLaw` carries the conclusion back to an arbitrary sample
space.

The joint rectangles are then fed to `conditionallyIID_of_jointRectangles`.

This advances `TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`, **Layer 6** — the conditional summit.

## Sources

The mathematical theorem is Kallenberg, *Probabilistic Symmetries and Invariance Principles* (2005),
Theorem 1.1, in its conditional form.

The joint-law upgrade formalized here is **new to this development**. `cameronfreer/exchangeability`
proves a `conditionallyIID_bind_of_contractable`, but under that repository's legacy naming
`ConditionallyIID` denotes the *mixture* identity — what TauCeti calls `MixedIID` — so it
establishes a strictly weaker statement, already available here as `mixedIID_of_contractable`. The
directing-measure joint-rectangle factorization and its symmetry transport were built from TauCeti's
own tail-factorization and exchangeable-σ-algebra API; no material is adapted.

/-- **Core set-integral identity.** The mass on the tail event `ν ⁻¹' S` intersected with a prefix
block cylinder is the integral of the directing-measure product over that event.

The tail event is `tailProcess X`-measurable, so `setIntegral_condExp` may be tested against it, and
the prefix factorization then replaces the conditional expectation; the real/`ℝ≥0∞` conversion is
`ofReal_integral_eq_lintegral_prod_directingMeasure`. -/

/-- **Symmetry transport.** On path space the core identity holds for every *injective* selection,
not just the prefix.

A finitely supported permutation realising `k` on the initial segment pulls the prefix
cylinder back to the `k`-cylinder. The directing measure is `pathTail`-measurable, hence
measurable for the exchangeable σ-algebra, hence fixed by that reindexing, so the
directing-measure event is pulled back to itself. Contractability gives exchangeability,
under which the reindexing preserves the measure, and the prefix case applies. -/

# The de Finetti barycenter of a mixing law

De Finetti's representation is a map in one direction and a theorem in the other. This file builds
the map. For a measure `π` on `ProbabilityMeasure α` — a *mixing law* — the **de Finetti
barycenter**

```text
deFinettiBarycenter π = ∫ P^{⊗ℕ} dπ(P)
```

is the `Measure.bind` of `π` against the countable-power kernel `P ↦ P^{⊗ℕ}`, equivalently the
barycenter (`Measure.join`) of the pushforward of `π` along `P ↦ P^{⊗ℕ}`; that second reading is
the one that makes the representation an *ergodic decomposition*, since every `P^{⊗ℕ}` is an
extreme exchangeable law (`infinitePi_mem_extremePoints_exchangeable`). The definition accepts an
arbitrary measure `π`; when `π` is a probability measure the barycenter is the law on `ℕ → α` of a
sequence drawn i.i.d. from a `π`-random probability measure.

The map is affine in the mixing law — `deFinettiBarycenter_add` and Mathlib's `Measure.bind_smul`
— sends probability measures to exchangeable probability measures, and, by de Finetti's theorem,
hits every exchangeable probability law exactly once
(`ExchangeableLaw.existsUnique_mixingLaw`). The packaging of that bijection as an equivalence, and
its restriction to point masses, is in `TauCeti.Probability.DeFinetti.Correspondence`.

This is the object the Layer 8 bullet of `TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md` — "package
`p ↦ p^{⊗ℕ}` and the de Finetti barycenter as an affine correspondence between mixing laws and
exchangeable path laws" — asks for. The expression `π.bind (P ↦ P^{⊗ℕ})` already occurs unnamed
throughout the de Finetti development (`deFinetti_mixture`, `mixedIID_mixingLaw_unique`,
`Measure.ext_of_bind_infinitePi_eq`); naming it is what lets the correspondence be stated.

## Main results

* `deFinettiBarycenter` — the mixture of countable powers along a mixing law.
* `deFinettiBarycenter_dirac` — a point mass mixes to a single i.i.d. law.
* `deFinettiBarycenter_zero`, `deFinettiBarycenter_add`, `deFinettiBarycenter_smul` — affinity in
  the mixing law.
* `exchangeableLaw_deFinettiBarycenter` — every barycenter of a mixing probability law is an
  exchangeable path law.
* `ExchangeableLaw.existsUnique_mixingLaw` — conversely, an exchangeable probability law on
  `ℕ → α` is the barycenter of exactly one mixing law, for `α` standard Borel.

No material is adapted from `cameronfreer/exchangeability`, which carries the mixture
representation only as an unnamed `bind` expression and does not package the correspondence.

/-- The **de Finetti barycenter** of a mixing law `π` on `ProbabilityMeasure α`: the measure
`∫ P^{⊗ℕ} dπ(P)` on `ℕ → α` mixing the countable powers against `π`. For `π` a probability

This is the path-law form of `deFinetti_mixture`, obtained by taking the coordinate process of
`ρ` itself: existence is de Finetti's theorem and uniqueness is injectivity of the mixture. The
state space needs no nonemptiness hypothesis, since a probability measure on `ℕ → α` already
exhibits a point of `α`. -/

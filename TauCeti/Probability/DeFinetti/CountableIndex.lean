# De Finetti's theorem for countable index types

De Finetti's theorem is independent of the particular enumeration of a countably infinite index
type. This file transports the sequence theorem along an equivalence with `ℕ`.

## Main results

* `conditionallyIID_of_exchangeableFamily_of_equiv_nat` gives the transport along an
  explicit equivalence `ι ≃ ℕ`.
* `conditionallyIID_of_exchangeableFamily` chooses such an equivalence from `[Countable ι]`
  and `[Infinite ι]`.

This implements the Layer 8 target “de Finetti for other countable index types” in
`TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`. The proof reuses the sequence theorem
`conditionallyIID_of_exchangeable`; no new measure-theoretic argument is required.

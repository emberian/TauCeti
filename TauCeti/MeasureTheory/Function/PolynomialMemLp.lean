# Integrability and `L²` membership of polynomials against a finite-moment measure

This file proves that a real polynomial, evaluated pointwise, is integrable and square-integrable
against any measure on `ℝ` all of whose polynomial moments are finite:

* `integrable_eval_of_forall_integrable_pow` — a polynomial is integrable, being a finite linear
  combination of monomials;
* `memLp_two_eval_of_forall_integrable_pow` — a polynomial is in `L²`, since the square of a
  polynomial is again a polynomial (hence integrable), and `memLp_two_iff_integrable_sq`.

Both consume only the moment hypothesis `∀ k, Integrable (x ↦ xᵏ) μ`, with no dependence on the
particular measure, so they apply verbatim to the Gaussian measure (all moments finite by Fernique)
and to the compactly supported Chebyshev measure alike.

Building on the `L²` membership, `polynomialEvalLp` bundles polynomial evaluation, cast into any
`[RCLike 𝕜]` scalar field, as an `ℝ`-linear map `ℝ[X] →ₗ[ℝ] Lp 𝕜 2 μ`.  Being measure- and
scalar-generic, it is the shared construction underlying the Gaussian and Chebyshev orthogonal-basis
targets.

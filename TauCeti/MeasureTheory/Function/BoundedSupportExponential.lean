# Exponential moments from bounded support

This file records a small bounded-support integrability principle used by the
`OrthogonalL2Bases` roadmap's moment-determinacy route.  If a measure is supported where the
argument norm is essentially bounded, multiplying an integrable function by any exponential
weight `exp (a * ‖x‖)` preserves integrability.  On `ℝ`, this gives the corresponding
`exp (a * |x|)` form.

The Chebyshev `T` measure is supported on `[-1, 1]`, so this is the reusable bookkeeping behind
the finite exponential moments needed before the Chebyshev Hilbert-basis construction.

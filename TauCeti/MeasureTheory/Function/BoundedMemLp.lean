# `Lᵖ` membership of a bounded observable of an a.e.-measurable map

On a finite measure space, a bounded measurable observable of an a.e.-measurable map lies in every
`Lᵖ`.  This is the pointwise composition fact underlying the bounded-observable entry point to the
L² lane of the Exchangeability roadmap; it carries no probabilistic content and applies to a single
map.

* `memLp_comp_of_bound` — if `f` is measurable, `g` is a.e. measurable, and `f ∘ g` is a.e. bounded,
  then `fun ω => f (g ω)` is in `Lᵖ` for every exponent.

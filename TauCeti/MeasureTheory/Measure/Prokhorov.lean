# Weak cluster limits of tight finite measures

This file contains a generic finite-measure extraction lemma based on Mathlib's Prokhorov
compactness theorem for finite measures. It has no real-line support condition and no
normalization step: tightness and a uniform mass bound place the sequence in a compact set of
`FiniteMeasure`s, and compactness gives a weak cluster limit.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.finite_measure_cluster_limit`: a tight, mass-bounded sequence of finite measures has a
  weak cluster limit along an ultrafilter below `atTop`.
* `TauCeti.finite_measure_subseq_limit`: the corresponding subsequence form when the weak topology
  on `FiniteMeasure α` is first-countable.

## References

* Roadmap: `TauCetiRoadmap/OneParameterSemigroups/README.md`, Part B (Bernstein theorem milestone).

/-- A tight family of measures admits a **monotone** exhaustion by compact sets whose complements
carry uniformly small mass: given tolerances `u j > 0`, there are compact `K j`, increasing in `j`,
with `σ n (K j)ᶜ ≤ u j` for every `n`. Accumulating the sets supplied by tightness is what turns
the unrelated compact sets into the monotone family Mathlib's Prokhorov criterion expects. -/

/-- A tight, uniformly mass-bounded sequence of finite measures has a weak cluster limit.

Given tightness of the sequence and a common total-mass bound, the conclusion is a finite limiting
measure with the same mass bound and weak convergence of all bounded-continuous test-function
integrals along an ultrafilter `U ≤ atTop`; no first-countability assumption on `FiniteMeasure α`
is needed. -/

# The Giry monad's `map`/`bind` interchange laws

Two ways `Measure.map` and `Measure.bind` commute:

* `map_bind` — pushing a mixture forward is the mixture of the pushforwards,
  `map F ∘ bind g = bind (map F ∘ g)`;
* `bind_map` — binding after a pushforward reindexes the mixing measure,
  `bind g ∘ map f = bind (g ∘ f)`.

Mathlib carries both for `PMF` (`PMF.map_bind`, `PMF.bind_map`) but neither for `Measure`,
although all of their ingredients — `Measure.bind_bind`, `Measure.bind_dirac_eq_map`,
`Measure.dirac_bind` — are there. This file supplies the missing `Measure` forms.

They are the shape mixture arguments want: `bind` is how a random measure is integrated against
its mixing law, so pushing a mixture forward along a coordinate map (a marginal), or rewriting a
mixture over a pushforward mixing law, are both routine steps.

/-- **Naturality of `bind`.** Pushing a `Measure.bind` mixture forward by a measurable map
commutes with the bind: the pushforward of the mixture is the mixture of the pushforwards, i.e.
the Giry-monad identity `map F ∘ bind g = bind (map F ∘ g)`.

Obtained from associativity of `bind` together with `bind_dirac_eq_map`. -/

/-- **Binding after a pushforward.** Binding `g` against a pushforward measure reindexes the
mixing measure: `bind g ∘ map f = bind (g ∘ f)`.

This is the `Measure` form of `PMF.bind_map`, and like it is a `simp` lemma: it rewrites a bind of
a mapped measure into the canonical single-bind form. -/

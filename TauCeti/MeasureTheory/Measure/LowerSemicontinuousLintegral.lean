# Lower semicontinuity of a lower semicontinuous integrand in the measure

Fix a lower semicontinuous `f : Ω → ℝ≥0∞` on a pseudometric space. This file proves that the
pairing `μ ↦ ∫⁻ x, f x ∂μ` is lower semicontinuous for the weak topology on `FiniteMeasure Ω` and
on `ProbabilityMeasure Ω`, together with the two consequences the direct method of the calculus of
variations runs on: the `liminf` inequality along a weakly convergent family, and attainment of the
infimum on a nonempty compact set of measures.

For a bounded continuous integrand the pairing is *continuous* — that is what the weak topology is
defined by. The content here is that dropping boundedness and continuity down to lower
semicontinuity costs exactly one half of that continuity, and no integrability hypothesis at all:
the value `∞` is allowed on both sides.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.lowerSemicontinuous_lintegral_finiteMeasure` and
  `TauCeti.lowerSemicontinuous_lintegral_probabilityMeasure`: the pairing is lower semicontinuous.
* `TauCeti.le_liminf_lintegral_of_tendsto_probabilityMeasure` and
  `TauCeti.le_liminf_lintegral_of_tendsto_finiteMeasure`: the `liminf` form along a weakly
  convergent family.
* `TauCeti.exists_isMinOn_lintegral`: a nonempty compact set of probability measures contains one
  minimising the integral, with no finiteness assumption on the minimum value.
* `TauCeti.isClosed_setOfPred_lintegral_le_finiteMeasure` and
  `TauCeti.isClosed_setOfPred_lintegral_le_probabilityMeasure`: the sublevel sets of the pairing
  are closed.

## Implementation notes

The proof is the standard monotone-approximation argument: `TauCeti.lscApprox` writes `f` as the
pointwise supremum of an increasing sequence of bounded continuous `ℝ≥0`-valued functions, the
monotone convergence theorem turns that into a supremum of integrals, each summand is continuous in
the measure because it is a weak-topology test function, and a supremum of continuous functions is
lower semicontinuous.

Only `OpensMeasurableSpace Ω` is used on the measurable side: it is what makes a lower
semicontinuous function measurable, and Mathlib's weak topology is already available at that
generality.

# Integrals of odd functions over symmetric intervals

An odd integrand into a real normed space integrates to zero over an interval `[-R, R]`
symmetric about the origin.

No integrability hypothesis is needed. The substitution `t ↦ -t` carries `[-R, R]` to itself, so
`intervalIntegral.integral_comp_neg` identifies the integral with the integral of `t ↦ g (-t)`;
oddness turns that into the negative of the original, and in a real vector space an element equal
to its own negative is zero. In particular the statement is also true (vacuously, both sides being
`0`) when `g` fails to be integrable.

## Main results

* `intervalIntegral.integral_eq_zero_of_odd` — `∫ t in -R..R, g t = 0` for odd `g`.

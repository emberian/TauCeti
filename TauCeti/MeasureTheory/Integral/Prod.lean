# Product-measure helpers: a.e. transfer along the projections, and a Dynkin step for integrals

Two small pieces of product-measure theory with no `L²` or inner-product content.

* `TauCeti.ae_of_ae_fst` / `TauCeti.ae_of_ae_snd` transfer an a.e. statement about one factor to the
  product measure, along `Measure.quasiMeasurePreserving_fst` / `_snd`.
* `TauCeti.setIntegral_eq_zero_of_forall_prod` is the binary-product specialization of the Dynkin
  (π-λ) step for Bochner integrals: a function whose integral vanishes on every measurable rectangle
  has vanishing integral on every measurable set. Rectangles are a π-system generating the product
  σ-algebra (`MeasureTheory.isPiSystem_prod`, `MeasureTheory.generateFrom_prod`), so this is the
  general `TauCeti.setIntegral_eq_zero_of_isPiSystem` instantiated at that π-system; the only work
  left here is extracting the whole-space hypothesis from the rectangle `univ ×ˢ univ`.

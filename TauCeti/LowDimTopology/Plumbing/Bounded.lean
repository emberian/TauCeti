# Boundedness of the lattice chain complex

The cubical degree of a plumbing-lattice generator is the cardinality of its finite set of
directions. For a plumbing graph on `V`, this degree is therefore at most `Fintype.card V`.
The grading-level bounds are established in `Grading.lean`. This file turns them into the
corresponding categorical facts about Némethi's lattice complex: its chain objects are zero
precisely above the number of vertices, the complex is exact there, and its homology vanishes in
every degree above that bound.

The characterization of the zero chain groups is sharp. In every degree at most
`Fintype.card V`, a subset of the vertex set of that cardinality supplies a cube generator and
hence a nonzero chain. This rules out obtaining boundedness from a degenerate chain model and
makes the result useful when reducing explicit lattice-homology computations to finitely many
cubical degrees.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.isZero_latticeChainComplex_X_iff_card_lt`: the categorical chain object
  has the same sharp vanishing range.
* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.isZero_latticeChainHomology_of_card_lt`: lattice homology vanishes
  above the number of plumbing vertices.

# A diagonal-dominance criterion for negative-definite plumbings

Némethi's lattice homology takes as its standing hypothesis a **negative-definite** plumbing
graph: the intersection form of the plumbed four-manifold must be negative definite on the whole
lattice. Checking this directly means diagonalizing (or completing the square on) the intersection
matrix, which is what `NegativeDefinite.lean` does by hand for the `A₂` plumbing. This file
supplies a general, purely combinatorial sufficient condition that avoids that work.

The condition is **strict diagonal dominance** of the negated intersection matrix `-A`: for every
sphere `i`, the framing is more negative than the number of neighbours,

`degree i < - weight i`.

Since the off-diagonal entries of `-A` are minus the adjacency indicators, the row sum of their
absolute values off the diagonal is exactly `degree i`, so the displayed inequality says that the
diagonal entry `- weight i` strictly dominates that row sum. The standard arithmetic-geometric
bound `2 (x i)(x j) ≤ (x i)² + (x j)²` on each edge then gives, for every lattice vector `x`,

`x · x ≤ ∑ i, (weight i + degree i) · (x i)²`,

whose right-hand side is a sum of nonpositive terms that is strictly negative once `x ≠ 0`. Hence
the intersection form is strictly negative away from the origin, which is the self-pairing form of
negative-definiteness. This recovers `a2Plumbing_isNegativeDefinite` (each vertex of the `A₂`
plumbing has degree `1` and framing `-2`) as a one-line instance, and, more usefully, certifies
negative-definiteness of every plumbing whose framings are sufficiently negative — the generic
Seifert-fibred examples — without any per-graph square completion.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.intersectionForm_self_le_weight_add_degree`: the diagonal-dominance upper
  bound `x · x ≤ ∑ i, (weight i + degree i) · (x i)²`.
* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.isNegativeDefinite_of_degree_lt_neg_weight`: strict diagonal dominance
  `degree i < - weight i` for all `i` implies the plumbing is negative definite.

/-- **Strict diagonal dominance implies negative-definiteness.** If every sphere's framing is more
negative than its number of neighbours, `degree i < - weight i`, then the plumbing is negative
definite.

The row-sum condition makes each coefficient `weight i + degree i` strictly negative, so the
diagonal-dominance bound `intersectionForm_self_le_weight_add_degree` expresses `x · x` as at most
a sum of nonpositive terms; picking a coordinate where `x` is nonzero makes that sum strictly
negative. -/

# The candidate genus field has degree `2 ^ t`

For a squarefree integer `d`, the degree of `candidateGenusField hd` over `ℚ` was computed in
`CandidateGenusField/Degree.lean` as `2 ^ (genusPrimeDiscriminants hd).card`, and its degree over
the embedded copy of `ℚ(√d)` in `CandidateGenusField/Relative/Degree.lean` as `2 ^ (t - 1)` for the
same `t`. Those exponents count a *chosen* prime-discriminant factorization of
`fundamentalDiscriminant d`. This file replaces them by the intrinsic invariant of `K = ℚ(√d)` that
genus theory names: the number `t` of rational primes ramifying in `K`.

That identification is `TauCeti.Multiquadratic.ncard_ramifiedPrimes_eq_card`, so all that happens
here is the substitution. Its point is that the exponents no longer depend on the choice made by
`genusPrimeDiscriminants`, and that the relative degree now reads as the classical `2 ^ (t - 1)` —
the field-theoretic half of the genus-theory `2`-rank formula, whose remaining half is the
isomorphism `Gal(K_gen/K) ≅ Cl⁺(K)/Cl⁺(K)²` with the *narrow* class group (not yet available). The
narrow class group is the right object here because `candidateGenusField` is unramified only at the
finite places; for imaginary `d` it agrees with `Cl(K)`, while for real `d` the ordinary quotient
can be smaller.

The `2 ^ (t - 1)` count for the genus field is classical; see D. A. Cox, *Primes of the Form
x² + ny²*, and F. Lemmermeyer, *Reciprocity Laws*.

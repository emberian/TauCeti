# The candidate genus field of `ℚ(√d)`

For a squarefree integer `d`, the *candidate genus field* of `ℚ(√d)` built here is the compositum
over `ℚ` of the quadratic fields `ℚ(√(radicand P))` attached to the prime discriminants `P` dividing
the fundamental discriminant `fundamentalDiscriminant d`. This compositum is unramified at the
*finite* places. For imaginary `d`, where the narrow and ordinary genus fields coincide, it is the
genus field of `ℚ(√d)`. For real `d` it is only the *narrow* candidate and may ramify at the
infinite places: e.g. `d = 3` has `disc = 12 = (-4)·(-3)`, so the compositum is `ℚ(i, √3)`, ramified
at the real places over `ℚ(√3)`. Identifying it with the genus field unramified at *all* places —
the ordinary one for real `d`, which needs the infinite-place condition — is later work.

This file gives the object a name. `GenusField` proved the underlying square-class facts for an
arbitrary finite set of prime discriminants with chosen roots; here we fix a choice — the
factorization finset `genusPrimeDiscriminants` from
`IsFundamentalDiscriminant.exists_finset_primeDiscriminant`, and chosen complex roots
`genusFieldRoot` of the radicands (using that `ℂ` is algebraically closed) — and package the
compositum as `candidateGenusField`. (Both choices are made with `choose`; independence of the
resulting field from them is not claimed here.) As a first property we record that it contains a
square root of `d`, so it really is a candidate genus field *of `ℚ(√d)`*.

The prime-discriminant description is classical; see D. A. Cox, *Primes of the Form x² + ny²*, and
F. Lemmermeyer, *Reciprocity Laws*.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Multiquadratic.candidateGenusField`: the candidate genus field of `ℚ(√d)`, as an
  intermediate field of `ℂ / ℚ`.
* `TauCeti.Multiquadratic.candidateGenusFieldGen`: each chosen root, viewed inside the candidate
  genus field.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Multiquadratic.candidateGenusField_le_iff`: its universal property — it is below an
  intermediate field iff that field contains every chosen root.
* `TauCeti.Multiquadratic.exists_mem_candidateGenusField_sq_eq`: it contains an element squaring
  to `d`.

# The ramified rational primes of a number field

The genus theory of a quadratic field is governed by the number `t` of rational primes that ramify
in it: the genus field has degree `2 ^ t` over `ℚ` and the `2`-rank of the narrow class group is
`t - 1`. This file names that set of primes and records its basic properties.

Mathlib phrases ramification of a rational prime `p` in a number field `K` as
`Algebra.IsUnramifiedIn (𝓞 K) (Ideal.span {(p : ℤ)})`, and characterises it by divisibility of the
discriminant (`NumberField.not_dvd_discr_iff_isUnramifiedIn`). We package the negation as a set of
natural primes, which is the form in which `t` is counted.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.NumberField.ramifiedPrimes`: the set of natural primes ramifying in `K`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.NumberField.mem_ramifiedPrimes_iff_dvd_discr`: a prime ramifies iff it divides the
  discriminant.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.finite_ramifiedPrimes`: only finitely many primes ramify.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.ramifiedPrimes_nonempty`: some prime ramifies, unless `K = ℚ`
  (Minkowski, via `NumberField.exists_not_isUnramifiedIn`).

`p` — as the ideal `span {p}` of `ℤ` — ramifies in the ring of integers of `K`. For a quadratic
field `K`, its cardinality is the `t` of genus theory. -/

# The narrow class group of a totally complex field

For a **totally complex** number field `K` (no real infinite places) the positivity condition is
vacuous: every unit is totally positive (`totallyPositiveUnits_eq_top`), so the forgetful surjection
`Cl⁺(K) → Cl(K)` is also injective. Hence the narrow and ordinary class groups **coincide** — as the
multiquadratic roadmap notes, for imaginary fields narrow = ordinary. (The `t - 1` genus-theory rank
formula concerns the *real* case, where the two can differ.)

## Main results

* `TauCeti.NumberField.NarrowClassGroup.toClassGroup_injective`: for a totally complex field the
  forgetful map `Cl⁺(K) → Cl(K)` is injective.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.NarrowClassGroup.toClassGroupEquiv`: the isomorphism `Cl⁺(K) ≃* Cl(K)`.

kernel is `mkPrincipal.range`, and every principal class is already trivial because principal ideals
have a (vacuously totally positive) generator. -/

# Prescribing the signs of a number field element at the real places

Weak approximation says that a number field `K` is dense in the product of its completions at the
infinite places; Mathlib records the diagonal form of this,
`NumberField.InfinitePlace.denseRange_algebraMap_pi`, on the product of the copies of `K` carrying
the topology of each infinite place. This file turns that topological statement into the
arithmetic one it is used for: an element of `K` may be prescribed, independently at each real
place, to be positive or negative there.

The passage is the usual one. Approximating the tuple whose entry at a place is `1` or `-1` to
within `1` forces the sign of each real embedding of the approximating element, because a real
number within distance `1` of `±1` has the sign of `±1`; the same estimate at any one place, real
or complex, keeps the element away from `0`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.NumberField.exists_forall_infinitePlace_sub_lt`: weak approximation at the infinite
  places in `ε`-`δ` form, with targets in `K` measured by the places themselves.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.exists_ne_zero_forall_isReal_pos`: a nonzero element of `K` whose real
  embeddings have prescribed signs.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.exists_ne_zero_neg_iff_mem`: the same statement with the prescription given
  as the set of real places at which the element is to be negative.

/-- **Weak approximation at the infinite places.** Given one target `a v : K` and one positive
tolerance `r v` for each infinite place `v` of a number field, some single `x : K` is within `r v`
of every target, as measured by the place at which that target was prescribed.

This is `NumberField.InfinitePlace.denseRange_algebraMap_pi` with the topology of the finite
product unwound into the individual places. -/

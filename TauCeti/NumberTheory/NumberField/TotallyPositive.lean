# Totally positive elements of a number field

An element `x` of a number field `K` is **totally positive** when it is strictly positive under
every real embedding `K →+* ℝ` — equivalently, at every real infinite place. This is the archimedean
positivity condition underlying the *narrow* class group of the multiquadratic roadmap (Layer 3):
the narrow class group `Cl⁺(K)` is the quotient of the fractional ideals by the principal ideals
admitting a totally positive generator. It surjects onto the ordinary class group `Cl(K)`
(forgetting the positivity condition), and the `2`-rank of `Cl⁺(K)` is what the genus-theory
`t - 1` formula (with `t` the number of ramified primes) computes for a **real quadratic** field
in the multiquadratic roadmap.

This file introduces the predicate and its multiplicative structure. The totally positive elements
are closed under multiplication and inversion and contain every nonzero square, so the totally
positive units form a subgroup of `Kˣ`. That subgroup is the kernel of the sign (signature) map on
units; the signs *not* realized by units measure the difference between `Cl⁺(K)` and `Cl(K)`.

The file also records that `totallyPositiveUnits` has **finite index** — a finite intersection, over
the real places, of the finite-index preimages of the positive units of `ℝ` — which is what makes
the narrow class group finite (see `NarrowClassGroup.Finite`).

## Main definitions and results

* `TauCeti.NumberField.IsTotallyPositive`: strict positivity at every real place, with
  `isTotallyPositive_iff` its introduction/elimination form.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.isTotallyPositive_one`, `IsTotallyPositive.mul`, `IsTotallyPositive.inv`,
  `isTotallyPositive_sq`: the multiplicative structure, including that nonzero squares are totally
  positive.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.totallyPositiveUnits`: the subgroup of totally positive units of `Kˣ` (the
  kernel of the unit signature map), with `sq_mem_totallyPositiveUnits`. For a totally complex field
  it is everything (`totallyPositiveUnits_eq_top`), since total positivity is then vacuous
  (`not_isReal_of_isTotallyComplex` makes `IsTotallyPositive` `simp` to `True`).
* `TauCeti.NumberField.totallyPositiveIntegerUnits`: the corresponding subgroup of the arithmetic
  units `(𝓞 K)ˣ`, the preimage of `totallyPositiveUnits` under `(𝓞 K)ˣ → Kˣ`, with
  `mem_totallyPositiveIntegerUnits` and `sq_mem_totallyPositiveIntegerUnits`.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.finiteIndex_totallyPositiveUnits`: `totallyPositiveUnits` has finite index
  (via `Units.instFiniteIndexPosSubgroup` and the general `Subgroup.instFiniteIndexComap`).

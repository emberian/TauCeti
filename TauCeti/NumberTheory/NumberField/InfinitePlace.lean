# Totally complex fields and their infinite places

A field containing an element whose square is a negative rational is totally complex: a real
embedding would send that element to a real square root of a negative number. A totally complex
field, having only complex infinite places, is then unramified at every infinite place in any
extension.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.NumberField.isTotallyComplex_of_sq_ratCast_of_neg`: a negative square forces total
  complexity.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.IsUnramifiedAtInfinitePlaces_of_isTotallyComplex`: a totally complex base is
  unramified at all infinite places of any extension.

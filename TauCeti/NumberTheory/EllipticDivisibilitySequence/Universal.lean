# The universal normalised elliptic divisibility sequence

A normalised EDS over a commutative ring `R` is determined by three parameters `b, c, d : R`.
Taking those parameters to be three indeterminates gives the **universal** `normEDS` family

`universalNormEDS : ℤ → MvPolynomial NormEDSParam ℤ`,

of which every sequence **of the form** `normEDS b c d` is a specialization: it is
`universalNormEDS` followed by the evaluation sending the indeterminates to `b, c, d`
(`normEDS_eq_aeval`), and likewise for
`preNormEDS` and for the two complement sequences (`preNormEDS_eq_aeval`, `complEDS₂_eq_aeval`,
`complEDS_eq_aeval`).

Note the claim is about the *constructed function* `normEDS`, not about elliptic divisibility
sequences in the abstract: the pinned Mathlib does not know that `normEDS b c d` satisfies
`IsEllipticDvdSequence` — it records proving so as a TODO — so nothing here says every EDS arises
this way, only that every `normEDS b c d` does.

The point is that an identity between the terms of a sequence of the form `normEDS b c d` need
only be proved once, over `MvPolynomial NormEDSParam ℤ`, and then specialises to every ring and
every choice of parameters. Working universally also buys an integral domain to work in, which the
parameters' ring need not be.

## Main definitions

* `NormEDSParam`: a three-element index type for the parameters `b`, `c`, `d` of `normEDS`.
* `universalNormEDS`: `normEDS` over `ℤ[B, C, D]`, at the three indeterminates.

## Main results

* `normEDS_eq_aeval`: every sequence of the form `normEDS b c d` is `universalNormEDS` specialised
  along `NormEDSParam.rec b c d`.
* `preNormEDS_eq_aeval`, `complEDS₂_eq_aeval`, `complEDS_eq_aeval`: the same for the three companion
  sequences, each specialising **its own** construction over `ℤ[B, C, D]` — `preNormEDS`,
  `complEDS₂` and `complEDS` at the three indeterminates — not `universalNormEDS`, which is only
  the `normEDS` one.

## Implementation notes

The constructors of `NormEDSParam` are uppercase because they name indeterminates rather than
elements, matching `WeierstrassCurve.Coeff` in
`TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/Universal.lean`, which plays the same role for the
universal Weierstrass curve.

Only `normEDS` gets a named universal object. The three companion sequences are stated against
`preNormEDS (X B) (X C) (X D)` and its analogues written out, since naming each one would add three
definitions whose only use is to be unfolded — the sequences are already determined by the
parameters, and it is the specialization statement that consumers need, not a new name for its
left-hand side. Those three carry an explicit `X (R := ℤ)`: with the coefficient ring appearing
only under `aeval`, elaboration has nothing to pin it to and reports a stuck `CommSemiring`
instance otherwise.

## Provenance

Ported from D. K. Angdinata's `LutzNagell/EllipticDivisibilitySequence.lean` in AINTLIB
(`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0, `main` at `1c1c74664e40071c2c2165bc55ca2616a67ccd6b`),
declarations `Param`, `universalNormEDS`, `normEDS_eq_aeval`, `compl₂EDS_eq_aeval` and
`complEDS_eq_aeval`. **`Param` is spelt `NormEDSParam` here** — a root-level `Param` says nothing
about elliptic divisibility sequences and makes its namespace equally generic; that rename is an
adaptation made in this repository, not upstream's name. That file's header reads `Authors: David
Kurniadi Angdinata`; following this repository's convention for adapted material the upstream
authorship is credited here rather than in the copyright header. J. Xu is acknowledged for the
surrounding LutzNagell development — he authors `Universal.lean` and co-authors
`DivisionPolynomialOmega.lean` at the same revision — as context for this port, not as an author of
the declarations above.

The same declarations sit in **Mathlib PR #13057** (open, last updated 2024-07-31), the
upstreaming of that AINTLIB file, so they are portable under this project's rule and deduplicate
when it lands. `compl₂EDS` is spelt `complEDS₂` here, following Mathlib's subsequent rename of the
elliptic-net API (`addMulSub → IsEllipticNet.atom`, `net → IsEllipticNet.rel`,
`rel₄ → IsEllipticNet.atomRel`, `IsEllSequence → IsEllipticSequence`, `compl₂EDS → complEDS₂`),
which #13057 predates.

`preNormEDS_eq_aeval` is new: the source states the principle for `normEDS` and the two
complements but not for `preNormEDS`, although Mathlib's `map_preNormEDS` makes it the same
one-line proof and consumers reaching for the pre-normalised sequence would otherwise have to
redo it.

`universalNormEDS_ne_zero` is **not** here, and the reason is the import direction rather than a
gap. It rests on `normEDS 2 3 2 = id`, which is `normEDS_two_three_two_eq_id`; that in turn needs
`normEDS` to be an elliptic sequence, `isEllipticSequence_normEDS`, which is proved in
`NormEDS.lean` — downstream of this file, since `NormEDS.lean` imports it and not the other way
round. So the nonvanishing lemma is stated there, beside the identity it is one line from. (The
identity also uses `IsEllipticSequence.ext` from `Ext.lean`, but that file imports neither this one
nor `NormEDS.lean`, so it is not what fixes the direction.)

/-- **The universal `normEDS`**: `normEDS` over `ℤ[B, C, D]`, at the three indeterminates. Every
sequence of the form `normEDS b c d` is one of its specializations (`normEDS_eq_aeval`), so an
identity between such terms can be proved here once and read off for every ring and every choice of
parameters. -/

/-- The defining equation of `universalNormEDS`: `normEDS` at the three indeterminates. It is the
stable name for that expansion, so downstream proofs rewrite with a lemma rather than unfolding a
definition; it does not hide the representation, and its right-hand side is that representation.

It is stated at the level of functions, not pointwise. Downstream modules cannot see the body, so a
rewrite under a function-valued argument — `invarNum`, `IsEllipticNet` — needs this form; the
pointwise one is `congrFun universalNormEDS_def n`, and `@[simp]` rewrites the head constant, so
applied occurrences reach the same normal form either way. -/

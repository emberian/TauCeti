# Vanishing at zero and oddness of an elliptic sequence

`IsEllipticSequence W` constrains `W` on every triple of integers. Two facts about `W` alone
follow, given that suitable terms are nonzerodivisors: `W` vanishes at `0`, and `W` is an odd
function.

Both are used elsewhere as *hypotheses*. `Descent.lean` carries `zero : W 0 = 0` and
`odd : W.Odd` on `IsEllipticNet.of_rel` and on the two equivalences, and it must: those results
reconstruct the relation from the two doubling recurrences, so they cannot assume the relation
they are proving. The lemmas here go the other way — the relation is the hypothesis — so they
apply exactly where a caller already has `IsEllipticSequence W` in hand.

## Main results

* `IsEllipticSequence.zero`: `W 0 = 0`, given that some even term is a nonzerodivisor.
* `IsEllipticSequence.neg`: `W (-m) = -W m`, given that `W 1` and `W 2` are nonzerodivisors.

Nothing else is exported. `W.Odd` unfolds to `neg`'s statement, so a second declaration for
Mathlib's spelling would be a definitional restatement; a caller wanting `W.Odd` supplies `neg`
directly. No file consumes either lemma yet — `SignEquivariance.lean` and `Descent.lean` take
`W.Odd` and `W 0 = 0` as *hypotheses* and do not import this module. The symmetrisation the
oddness proof turns on is likewise a local `have`: a step of that argument, not a fact a caller
wants.

Neither lemma is `@[simp]`, and neither can be: `W` is a variable, so `W (-m)` has a variable head
symbol and Lean rejects the attribute outright — simp would have to try the rewrite at every step.
Mathlib tags `normEDS_neg`, `preNormEDS_neg` and `complEDS_neg` because those are stated for the
*concrete* sequences, whose head symbol is a constant.

## Implementation notes

Each proof specialises the relator at indices chosen to make all but one term cancel, then
divides by the surviving nonzerodivisor.

For `zero` the choice is `(m, m, 2 * m)`: the two outer terms of `rel` coincide and cancel, and
the first collapses to `W 0 * W (2 * m) ^ 3`.

For `neg` the relator is symmetrised first. Adding `rel W p q r 0` to `rel W q p r 0` cancels the
two outer terms against each other and leaves `(W (p - q) + W (q - p)) * W (p + q) * W r ^ 2`.
Choosing `(1 - k, k + 1, 1)` puts `2` in the middle slot and `-(2 * k)` in the first, and
`(-k, k + 1, 1)` puts `1` and `-(2 * k + 1)` there; those are the even and odd cases, and they are
why both `W 1` and `W 2` are needed.

The index arithmetic is left to `ring_nf` rather than to explicit rewrites. It has to happen
*inside* `W`'s argument: `W` is opaque, so `linear_combination` cannot on its own see that
`W (1 - k - (k + 1))` and `W (-(2 * k))` are the same term.

## Provenance

Adapted from D. K. Angdinata's `LutzNagell/EllipticDivisibilitySequence.lean` in AINTLIB
(`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0, `main` at `1c1c74664e40071c2c2165bc55ca2616a67ccd6b`),
declarations `IsEllSequence.zero`, `IsEllSequence.sub_add_neg_sub_mul_eq_zero` — inlined here as
a local step of `neg` rather than exported — and `IsEllSequence.neg`. That file's header reads
`Authors: David Kurniadi Angdinata`; following this repository's convention for adapted material
the upstream authorship is credited here rather than in the copyright header. J. Xu is
acknowledged for the surrounding LutzNagell development — he authors `Universal.lean` and
co-authors `DivisionPolynomialOmega.lean` at the same revision — as context for this port, not as
an author of the declarations above.

The source also carries a `zero'` proved from `IsReduced R` rather than from a nonzerodivisor.
It is not ported: `zero` below is what the development uses, and `IsReduced` is a hypothesis no
consumer in this repository has.

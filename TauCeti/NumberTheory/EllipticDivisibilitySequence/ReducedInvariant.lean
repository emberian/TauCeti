# The reduced invariant of a normalised EDS

For a normalised EDS `normEDS b c d`, the invariant of `IsEllipticNet` at `s = 1` carries a factor
that is constant in the index: `IsEllipticNet.invarNum` is divisible by `b = W 2`. This file names
the quotient `reducedInvarNum` and **proves** that cancellation.

The reduced numerator is a sum rather than a quotient: `reducedInvarNum` is defined outright as

`reducedInvarNum b c d m = complEDS₂ b c d m + normEDS b c d m ^ 3 * b + 2 * complEDS₂Aux b c d m`,

and `invarNum_normEDS_one_eq_reducedInvarNum_mul` is what identifies it as the cancellation,
`invarNum` being `reducedInvarNum * b`. Read the other way,
`complEDS₂_eq_reducedInvarNum_sub` expresses the second complement through the invariant — the step
by which the elliptic-net identities reach the division polynomials in the Lutz–Nagell development.

## Main definitions

* `reducedInvarNum`: the invariant numerator of a normalised EDS with one factor of `b` cancelled.
* `reducedInvarDenom`: the invariant denominator with the factor `b * c` cancelled — a six-way
  split on `m % 6`, since which of `W (m+1)`, `W m`, `W (m-1)` gives up `b = W 2` and `c = W 3`
  depends on the residue.

## Main results

* `IsEllipticNet.invarNum_normEDS_one_eq_reducedInvarNum_mul`: `invarNum (normEDS b c d) 1 m` is
  `reducedInvarNum b c d m * b` — the cancellation the reduced numerator is named for.
* `complEDS₂_eq_reducedInvarNum_sub`: the second complement read off the reduced numerator.
* `map_reducedInvarNum` and `map_reducedInvarDenom`: both are natural in the coefficient ring, so
  a specialisation or base change may be pushed through them rather than around the unexposed
  bodies.
* `IsEllipticNet.invarDenom_normEDS_one_eq_reducedInvarDenom_mul`: `invarDenom (normEDS b c d) 1 m`
  is `reducedInvarDenom b c d m * (b * c)` — the cancellation the reduced denominator is named
  for, with no hypotheses.
* `reducedInvarDenom_of_emod_eq_zero` and its five siblings: the per-residue elimination
  principle, one lemma per branch, so a consumer holding `m % 6 = r` reaches its branch without
  discharging the preceding `if` conditions.
* `reducedInvarDenom_zero`, `reducedInvarDenom_one`, `reducedInvarDenom_two`: its values at the
  small indices; the last is what fixes the normalisation.

## Both cancellations, and why neither needs a hypothesis

Each reduced quantity comes with the cancellation it is named for:
`invarNum_normEDS_one_eq_reducedInvarNum_mul` for the numerator, and
`invarDenom_normEDS_one_eq_reducedInvarDenom_mul` for the denominator. Both hold over an arbitrary
commutative ring.

The denominator side reads `invarDenom (normEDS b c d) 1 m = W (m + 1) * W m * W (m - 1)`, and
which of the three factors gives up `b = W 2` and `c = W 3` depends on `m` modulo `6` — hence the
six-way split. Each branch reindexes a complement by `normEDS_mul_complEDS` (`Complement.lean`),
`W k * complEDS b c d k n = W (n * k)`, taking `n = m / k` and turning `(m / k) * k` back into `m`
with `Int.ediv_mul_cancel` on the divisibility that `m % 6 = r` supplies. The residues `0`, `1`
and `5` go through the `6`-complement and rewrite `W 6` as `(W 5 - d ^ 2) * b * c`
(`WeierstrassCurve.normEDS_six`, `Six.lean`); the residues `2`, `3` and `4` split the work between
a `2`-complement and a `3`-complement.

Note that `b, c ≠ 0` over a domain would **not** by itself make `normEDS b c d 6` a
nonzerodivisor — that needs `normEDS b c d 5 - d ^ 2 ≠ 0` as well — which is why the
unconditional `normEDS_mul_complEDS` rather than a nonvanishing side condition is what makes this
statement hypothesis-free.

The numerator needs none of this because its cancellation is an identity between polynomial
expressions, proved by `ring` from the complement recurrences rather than through a division.

The divisor form is `normEDS_mul_complEDS_div`, which this development adds to `Complement.lean`
beside the identity it reindexes. Each residue reduces `W k * complEDS b c d k (n / k)` to
`W n` by `normEDS_mul_complEDS` — which is stated at `W (n * k)` — followed
by `Int.ediv_mul_cancel` on the divisibility that `m % 6 = r` supplies. The factor
`W 5 - d ^ 2` carried by the residues `0`, `1` and `5` is `W 6` with `b * c` removed, which is
`WeierstrassCurve.normEDS_six` (`Six.lean`).

For the other half of the reduced-invariant theory — `redInvar_normEDS ← invar₂_normEDS ←
invar_normEDS ← net_normEDS`, written in the source's names — every lower link has now landed:
`net_normEDS` is `isEllipticNet_normEDS` (`NormEDS.lean`), `invar_normEDS` is
`invarNum_mul_invarDenom` (`Invariant/Basic.lean`), and `invar₂_normEDS` is
`invarNum_normEDS_one_mul_eq_invarDenom_mul` (`Invariant/NormEDS.lean`), so `redInvar_normEDS`
alone remains there.

Everything below is independent of all of that: nothing carries an ellipticity hypothesis, and the
source discharges the ellipticity variables over exactly this block.

## Provenance

Ported from D. K. Angdinata's `LutzNagell/EllipticDivisibilitySequence.lean` in the AINTLIB
**NagellLutz** project (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0), at the revision
`TauCetiRoadmap` pins for that project, `dev/modular-curves @ 9fec8eba7652`. Declarations
`invarNum_normEDS`, `redInvarNum`, `compl₂EDS_eq_redInvarNum_sub`,
`invarNum_eq_redInvarNum_mul` and `map_redInvarNum` for the numerator, and `redInvarDenom`,
`redInvarDenom_zero`, `redInvarDenom_one`, `redInvarDenom_two`, `map_redInvarDenom` and
`invarDenom_eq_redInvarDenom_mul` for the denominator — the source's own names, which this file
respells with `reduced` written out.

Those names also occur in AINTLIB's **HasseWeil** project, pinned separately at
`dev/hasse-weil @ 513e83879e2f`, so the credit above picks between two candidates rather than
recording the only match a search returns. Two details fix it on NagellLutz. That project spells
the cancellation `invarDenom_eq_redInvarDenom_mul`, where HasseWeil spells it
`invarDenom_normEDS_eq_redInvarDenom_mul`; and its `map_redInvarDenom` is oriented
`f (redInvarDenom …) = redInvarDenom (f b) …`, where HasseWeil states the converse. This file
carries the NagellLutz spelling and the NagellLutz orientation in both places.

Six declarations here are **not** from that file: the `reducedInvarDenom_of_emod_eq_*` branch
lemmas have no counterpart in the source, which eliminates the split inline. The divisor-form
complement identity they rest on lives in `Complement.lean` as `normEDS_mul_complEDS_div`.

The source's `invarDenom_eq_redInvarDenom_mul`, which identifies the denominator formula as the
cancelled quotient, is ported here as
`IsEllipticNet.invarDenom_normEDS_one_eq_reducedInvarDenom_mul`. Both links the source's proof
uses are available in this repository: `normEDS_mul_complEDS_div` is ported by this development
into `Complement.lean`, derived there from the unconditional `normEDS_mul_complEDS` together with
`Int.ediv_mul_cancel` rather than proved afresh, and `normEDS_six_eq_mul` is
`WeierstrassCurve.normEDS_six` (`Six.lean`).

That file's header reads `Authors: David Kurniadi Angdinata`; following this
repository's convention for adapted material the upstream authorship is credited here rather than
in the copyright header. J. Xu is acknowledged for the surrounding LutzNagell development — he
authors `Universal.lean` and co-authors `DivisionPolynomialOmega.lean` at the same revision — as
context for this port, not as an author of the declarations above.

The **numerator** declarations sit in **Mathlib PR #13057**, the upstreaming of that AINTLIB
file, so they are portable under this project's rule and deduplicate if and when it lands. That
PR does not carry the denominator side, so nothing added here for the denominator is covered by
it — the deduplication claim scopes to the numerator alone.
They are spelt with Mathlib's later names (`compl₂EDS → complEDS₂`, `IsEllSequence →
IsEllipticSequence`), which #13057 predates, and follow `ComplAux.lean` in keeping the
`normEDS`-family declarations in the **root** namespace where Mathlib keeps `normEDS`, `complEDS`
and `complEDS₂`. Placement follows each left-hand side, so `reducedInvarNum`,
`reducedInvarNum_def`, `complEDS₂_eq_reducedInvarNum_sub` and `map_reducedInvarNum` all sit at
root, and only `invarNum_normEDS_one_eq_reducedInvarNum_mul`, whose left-hand side is an
`IsEllipticNet` term, sits in that namespace.

One adaptation is forced rather than chosen: the source proves `invarNum_normEDS` by
`simp [invarNum]`, unfolding the definition. That does not port, because `Invariant/Basic.lean`
exports
`invarNum`'s body unexposed — from an importing module `simp [invarNum]` is rejected outright — so
the proof goes through the `@[simp]` equation lemma `IsEllipticNet.invarNum_def` instead.

defeat the point of naming the term. -/
theorem reducedInvarNum_def : reducedInvarNum b c d m =
    complEDS₂ b c d m + normEDS b c d m ^ 3 * b + 2 * complEDS₂Aux b c d m := (rfl)

/-- The reduced invariant denominator, the counterpart of `reducedInvarNum`.

`IsEllipticNet.invarDenom_normEDS_one_eq_reducedInvarDenom_mul` is what identifies this with
`invarDenom (normEDS b c d) 1 m` divided by `b * c`, unconditionally over any commutative ring.
The paragraph below motivates the shape of the split.

`invarDenom (normEDS b c d) 1 m` is `W (m + 1) * W m * W (m - 1)`, and the divisibility
`W k ∣ W (n * k)` witnessed by Mathlib's `complEDS` lets `b = W 2` and `c = W 3` be taken out of
that product. Which factors give them up — and whether one factor supplies both or two factors
supply one each — depends on `m` modulo `6`, so the definition is a six-way split on `m % 6` rather
than a single formula. At residues `0`, `1` and `5` a single factor supplies both: the residue-`0`
case has `6 ∣ m`, so the middle factor `W m` gives up `b * c` at once through
`complEDS b c d 6 (m / 6)`, and the outer two survive whole. At residues `2`, `3` and `4` the work
is split between two factors, one giving up `b` through a `2`-complement and another giving up `c`
through a `3`-complement.

The factor `normEDS b c d 5 - d ^ 2` appearing in the residues `0`, `1` and `5` is `normEDS b c d
6` with `b * c` removed: `WeierstrassCurve.normEDS_six` reads `W 6 = (W 5 - d ^ 2) * b * c`, so a
residue that takes `b * c` out through the single `6`-complement is left carrying the remaining
factor. It is not claimed to be a unit: over an arbitrary commutative ring nothing here proves it
invertible. -/

/-- The defining formula for `reducedInvarDenom`. The definition body is not exposed, so this
equation lemma is how a consumer computes with it.

Not `@[simp]`, but **not** for `reducedInvarNum_def`'s reason. There the point is that `simp`
should never unfold the term at all. Here it should: the whole content of `reducedInvarDenom` is
the residue split, so the six `reducedInvarDenom_of_emod_eq_*` lemmas below *are* `@[simp]` and do
unfold it — each into a single product, once the residue is known.

What is wrong is unfolding it into the six-way `if` chain, which is what tagging this lemma would
do: every goal mentioning `reducedInvarDenom` would acquire five undischarged conditions, and the
branch lemmas would then have nothing left to fire on. So the simp normal form of
`reducedInvarDenom b c d m` is "the selected branch, when `m % 6` is known, and the folded term
otherwise" — which is exactly this lemma off simp and those six on. -/

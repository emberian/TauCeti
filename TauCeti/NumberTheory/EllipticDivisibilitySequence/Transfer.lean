# Index bookkeeping for the descent on the elliptic relator

Mathlib's `IsEllipticNet.atomRel_avg_sub` transfers the four-index relator from a quadruple
`a, b, c, d` to the quadruple obtained by subtracting each index from the average
`m = (a + b + c + d) / 2`, in reverse order:

`atomRel W (m - d) (m - c) (m - b) (m - a) = atomRel W a b c d`.

The descent that identifies elliptic sequences runs on that transfer, and needs to know that its
two side conditions survive it: the four indices stay of one parity, and — after taking the
absolute value of the last, which `IsEllipticNet.atomRel_abs₄` absorbs — they stay nonnegative and
strictly decreasing. This file proves both, together with the bound `6 ≤ a` that makes the descent
terminate.

## Main definitions

* `IsEllipticNet.NonnegStrictAnti₄`: the four indices are nonnegative and strictly decreasing.
  The name carries both halves of the definition — Mathlib's `StrictAnti` on the tuple, and the
  lower bound bundled alongside it because every use needs the two together.

## Main results

* `IsEllipticNet.parity_abs_avg_sub`: same parity survives the transfer, with the witness taken
  relative to the entry `atomRel_abs₄` leaves under an absolute value.
* `IsEllipticNet.nonnegStrictAnti₄_iff`: the predicate as the lower bound `0 ≤ d` together
  with the three adjacent inequalities.
* `IsEllipticNet.nonnegStrictAnti₄_abs_avg_sub`: nonnegativity and strict decrease survive it.
* `IsEllipticNet.six_le_of_parity_of_nonnegStrictAnti₄`: a strictly decreasing quadruple
  of one parity with `0 ≤ d` has `6 ≤ a` — consecutive indices differ by at least two, three
  times over.

## Implementation notes

Parity is spelled as Mathlib spells it for this API — the unbundled conjunction
`d % 2 = a % 2 ∧ d % 2 = b % 2 ∧ d % 2 = c % 2`, relative to the last index, as
`IsEllipticNet.atomRel_eq` and `atomRel_avg_sub` take it — rather than as the source's bundled
predicate over `Int.negOnePow`. Matching the upstream shape means those two lemmas apply with no
conversion at the use sites, and avoids standing a second parity predicate next to Mathlib's.

The ordering half reuses Mathlib's tuple API: it is `StrictAnti ![a, b, c, d]`, not a hand-rolled
chain of three inequalities. `Mathlib/Order/Fin/Tuple.lean` states that API through `vecCons` —
`strictAnti_vecCons` and `strictAnti_vecEmpty`, both `@[simp]` — so `simp` unfolds the tuple form
into the adjacent comparisons the descent consumes, and `nonnegStrictAnti₄_iff` records that
normal form once for downstream use.

**On the imports.** The rule here is: **public** for what the public *statements* mention,
**private** for what only the proofs need. So `Mathlib.Algebra.Order.Group.Int` and
`…Group.Unbundled.Abs` are public — the statements use ℤ arithmetic and `|…|` — as is
`Mathlib.Order.Fin.Tuple`, since `NonnegStrictAnti₄` is defined by `StrictAnti ![…]` and that
module supplies the vector notation too. `Mathlib.Data.Int.ModEq` and `Mathlib.Algebra.Order.Group
.Abs` are private, each used only inside a proof — the latter for `abs_cases`, which is
`to_additive`-generated from `mabs_cases` and so appears under no literal definition of its own.

**On the hypotheses.** `nonnegStrictAnti₄_abs_avg_sub` takes `d < c`, `2 ≤ c + d`, `c < b` and
`b < a` separately, rather than a bundled `NonnegStrictAnti₄`. Those are what the transferred
ordering actually needs: the descent supplies parity, and a same-parity gap is strictly stronger
than this — `(a, b, c, d) = (4, 3, 2, 1)` satisfies these and the conclusion while failing
`d + 2 ≤ c`. Only `parity_abs_avg_sub` and `six_le_of_parity_of_nonnegStrictAnti₄` genuinely need
parity as parity.

This file does **not** import `Mathlib.NumberTheory.EllipticDivisibilitySequence`. No declaration
here mentions `atom`, `atomRel` or `rel`: the statements are about ℤ arithmetic, order and parity,
and the EDS lemmas they are *for* — `atomRel_avg_sub`, `atomRel_abs₄`, `atomRel_eq` — are named in
the prose because that is what fixes the index shapes, not because anything here needs their API.
Importing the EDS module only to reach `abs_cases` through it cost 279 build jobs.

## Provenance

Ported from D. K. Angdinata's `LutzNagell/EllipticDivisibilitySequence.lean` in AINTLIB
(`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0, `main` at `1c1c74664e40071c2c2165bc55ca2616a67ccd6b`),
declarations `StrictAnti₄`, `HaveSameParity₄.transf`, `HaveSameParity₄.strictAnti₄_transf` and
`HaveSameParity₄.six_le_of_strictAnti₄`. That file's header reads `Authors: David Kurniadi
Angdinata`; following this repository's convention for adapted material the upstream authorship is
credited here rather than in the copyright header. J. Xu is acknowledged for the surrounding
LutzNagell development — he authors `Universal.lean` and co-authors `DivisionPolynomialOmega.lean`
at the same revision — as context for this port, not as an author of the declarations above. The
source's `StrictAnti₄` gains a `Nonneg` prefix here, because the predicate bundles the lower bound
`0 ≤ d` that the source's name left unsaid; the `StrictAnti` half is kept, the definition being
Mathlib's `StrictAnti` on the tuple. The dependent names follow it, and `six_le_of_parity_of_…`
names the parity hypothesis that its statement genuinely needs.

The source's surrounding transfer machinery is **not** ported, being already upstream: its
`rel₄_transf` is Mathlib's `atomRel_avg_sub`, its `rel₄_eq_net` is Mathlib's `atomRel_eq`, and its
`avg₄` is inlined there as `(a + b + c + d) / 2`. With `rel₄_transf` unneeded, so are the four
declarations existing only to prove it — `addMulSub₄`, `addMulSub₄_mul_addMulSub₄`,
`addMulSub_transf` and `avg₄_add_avg₄`. That is also why no `set_option allowUnsafeReducibility`
appears here: the one source lemma carrying it is among those not needed.

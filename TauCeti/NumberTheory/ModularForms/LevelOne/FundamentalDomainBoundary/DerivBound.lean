# A uniform derivative bound for the boundary contour

The derivative of the boundary contour is bounded at every parameter: off the three corners
each piece has a constant derivative or a scaled unit tangent, and at a corner the contour is
not differentiable — the one-sided chords disagree — so `deriv` takes its junk value `0`.
One constant therefore bounds the whole contour.

This is the growth input of the on-curve principal values at a fixed excision radius: on
the complement of an `ε`-ball around a point of the contour, the winding integrand
`(γ t - s)⁻¹ • deriv γ t` is bounded in norm by `ε⁻¹` times this bound. Integrability of that
integrand is a separate matter, and needs the derivative rather than the contour: it is
`TauCeti.Contour.intervalIntegrable_inv_sub_mul_deriv`, from the continuity of `γ`, its
avoidance of `s`, and the interval integrability of `deriv γ` — the last of which the bound
proved here does not by itself supply. The bound also degrades as `ε` shrinks, so it is not a
dominator for the excision limit itself, which rests on the symmetric cancellation at the
crossing.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.ModularForm.not_differentiableAt_fdBoundary_one`, `…_three`, `…_four`: the
  contour is not differentiable at its corners, with the `@[simp]` normal forms
  `TauCeti.ModularForm.deriv_fdBoundary_one`, `…_three`, `…_four` recording that `deriv`
  is `0` there.
* `TauCeti.ModularForm.exists_norm_deriv_fdBoundary_le`: a bound on `‖deriv (fdBoundary H)‖`
  valid at every parameter.

corners the derivative is one of the four piecewise values — the two vertical chords, the
arc's `π/6`-scaled unit tangent, and the ceiling's `1` — each bounded by one summand, and at
a corner the contour is not differentiable, so `deriv` takes its junk value `0` there.

The bound is an existential over a positive constant, the form its consumers use: at a fixed
excision radius they need only *some* bound on the contour's speed. -/

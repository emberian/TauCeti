# The arc keeps its distance from the vertical excision centres

The principal-value assembly of the valence formula excises the union
`arcSingularSet S ∪ verticalSingularSet S`. Along the closed arc `[1, 3]` of the boundary
contour only the arc part can fire once `ε` is small: a vertical centre outside the arc set
never lies on the closed arc — the open arc has `|re| < 1/2` strictly, and the endpoints are
the corners `ρ + 1` and `ρ`, which the arc set contains *unconditionally* — so compactness
gives a positive distance from the arc to each such centre, uniform over the finitely many of
them. Below that distance the union excision test agrees with its arc part at every arc
parameter, which is what lets the arc pairing machinery, built for unit-norm inversion-closed
excision sets, apply to the union.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.ModularForm.exists_pos_forall_le_norm_fdBoundary_sub_of_mem_verticalSingularSet`:
  a positive `δ` under the distance from every arc point to every vertical centre outside the
  arc set.
* `TauCeti.ModularForm.exists_norm_fdBoundary_sub_le_union_iff`: for `ε` under that distance
  the union excision test along the arc reads the same as the arc-only test.
* `TauCeti.ModularForm.eventually_forall_lt_norm_fdBoundary_sub_of_mem_verticalSingularSet`:
  the separation holds for every sufficiently small `ε > 0`.

  bounds, the corner capture, the compactness minimum, and the `∀ᶠ` reduction of the union
  test to the arc test) this file ports onto the current Mathlib pin.

/-- **The arc keeps a positive distance from the non-arc vertical centres.** The closed arc is

/-- **Under the separation the union excision test degenerates to its arc part on the arc.**
The vertical centres already in the arc set are absorbed by it, and the remaining ones are
farther than `ε` from every arc point by `hfar`, so along the arc only the arc part of the
union can fire. -/

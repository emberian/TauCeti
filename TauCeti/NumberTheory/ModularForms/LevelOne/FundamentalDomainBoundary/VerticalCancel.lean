# The vertical integrals of a periodic integrand cancel

The reflection `t ↦ 4 - t` carries the right vertical of the boundary contour onto the
left vertical through the translation `z ↦ z - 1`, reversing the orientation. For any
integrand `φ` of period `1` — the level-one situation, where `φ` is the logarithmic
derivative of the extension of a modular form — the left vertical contour integral of
`γ' • φ ∘ γ` is therefore the negative of the right one: the values are identified by
periodicity and the derivatives by the reflection, up to the orientation sign. The
statement is unconditional: the substitution and the interior congruence need no
integrability.

The cancellation also survives `ε`-excision, which is what the principal-value assembly of
the valence formula needs: when the form vanishes at a point *on* the contour the integrand
is not interval-integrable there, so the boundary integral is assembled from an excised
integrand and the limit taken only after the pieces are combined. The excised cancellation
holds whenever the excision set is invariant under the reflection `z ↦ -conj z` that
exchanges the two verticals — reflection invariance, not translation closure, is the usable
hypothesis, since a finite set closed under `s ↦ s + 1` is empty.

/-- **The excision test is invariant under the vertical reflection.** On the verticals the
substitution `t ↦ 4 - t` acts as `z ↦ -conj z`, since there the real part is `±1/2`. That map
is an isometry of `ℂ`, so it carries the `ε`-ball around a centre to the `ε`-ball around the
reflected centre; for an excision set closed under the reflection the test therefore reads the
same at `4 - u` as at `u`.

Reflection invariance, not translation closure, is the right hypothesis: a finite set closed
under `s ↦ s + 1` would have to be empty, since it has an element of largest real part. -/

/-- **The vertical cancellation survives excision.** The reflection `t ↦ 4 - t` carries the right
vertical onto the left by `z ↦ -conj z`, an isometry of `ℂ`, so an integrand excised within `ε`
of a set invariant under that reflection is excised at matching parameters on the two verticals,
and the cancellation of the untruncated integrals
(`TauCeti.ModularForm.intervalIntegral_fdBoundarySegment4_eq_neg_segment1`) persists.

Reflection invariance, not translation closure, is the right hypothesis: the two verticals are
exchanged by `z ↦ -conj z`, and being an isometry it moves an `ε`-ball to an `ε`-ball. (A set
closed under the bare translation `s ↦ s + 1` would have to be empty, since a finite set has an
element of largest real part.) For `TauCeti.ModularForm.verticalSingularSet` the invariance is the
composite of `re_eq_of_mem_verticalSingularSet` with `sub_one_mem_verticalSingularSet` or
`add_one_mem_verticalSingularSet`, whose translations are conditional on the real part. -/

# The winding number of each boundary piece is a principal logarithm

Each smooth piece of the boundary contour of the truncated fundamental domain is confined
to an axis-aligned half-plane: the verticals have constant real part `±1/2`, the arc stays
below height `1`, and the truncation ceiling has constant height `H`. About a point `w` on
the far side of the corresponding line, the chord ratios of the piece therefore lie in the
slit plane, so its index integral is a principal logarithm of the endpoint ratio and the
winding number of the piece is `(2πi)⁻¹` times that logarithm.

Summing the four values over the piece decomposition and pinning with integrality is how
the interior winding number `-1` of the contour is computed.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.ModularForm.windingNumber_fdBoundarySegment1_eq_log`,
  `TauCeti.ModularForm.windingNumber_fdBoundary_arc_eq_log`,
  `TauCeti.ModularForm.windingNumber_fdBoundarySegment4_eq_log` and
  `TauCeti.ModularForm.windingNumber_fdBoundarySegment5_eq_log` — the four logarithm values.

## References

The piece-logarithm evaluation follows the fundamental-domain boundary development of
AINTLIB's `LeanModularForms` (`ForMathlib/FDBoundary.lean`, `FDBoundaryH.lean`,
`FDBoundaryPath.lean`); the logarithm FTC and the slit-plane criteria are Tau Ceti's.

# Finite sums of functions vanishing or bounded along a filter

Mathlib's `Filter.ZeroAtFilter` and `Filter.BoundedAtFilter` are closed under binary sums
(`Filter.ZeroAtFilter.add`, `Filter.BoundedAtFilter.add`), and the bounded functions are closed
under a `Finset.prod` (`Filter.BoundedAtFilter.prod`, via `boundedFilterSubalgebra`). The additive
counterpart of that product lemma is not recorded upstream; this file adds it for both predicates.

The gap shows up wherever an operator is a finite sum of slashes: proving that such an operator
stays bounded, or stays vanishing, along `atImInfty` is an induction over the summands, and
without these each call site reruns it.

## Main results

* `Filter.ZeroAtFilter.sum`: a finite sum of functions vanishing along `l` vanishes along `l`.
* `Filter.BoundedAtFilter.sum`: a finite sum of functions bounded along `l` is bounded along `l`.

## Provenance

No code is transcribed. The gap was identified while porting the cusp chain of the AINTLIB
`LeanModularForms` project (Chris Birkbeck, Apache-2.0),
`LeanModularForms/HeckeRIngs/GL2/AdjointTheory.lean` at commit
`2baa76f742bdb4fb8ee323fabba41203bd390e08`: its `heckeT_p_ut_zero_at_cusps` (lines 62-70)
open-codes precisely this induction with `Finset.sum_induction`, which is also the proof plan
`BoundedAtFilter.sum` follows below. The statements here are about Mathlib's
`Filter.ZeroAtFilter` / `Filter.BoundedAtFilter` at an arbitrary filter and index type, not about
modular forms.

# Hooks and hook lengths of a Young diagram

The *hook* of a cell `c` of a Young diagram `μ` consists of `c` itself, the cells of `μ` strictly to
the right of `c` in its row (its *arm*), and the cells of `μ` strictly below `c` in its column (its
*leg*).  Its cardinality is the *hook length* `hookLength μ c`, the quantity appearing in the
hook-length formula `f^μ · ∏_{c ∈ μ} hookLength μ c = μ.card !`.

This file defines `YoungDiagram.arm`, `YoungDiagram.leg` and `YoungDiagram.hook` as finite sets of
cells, together with the numerical `armLength`, `legLength` and `hookLength`, and proves that the
cardinalities agree.  The basic theory is then developed: transposition exchanges arms and legs,
hook lengths strictly decrease along a row and down a column, a cell has hook length `1` exactly
when it is a corner of the diagram, and the product of the hook lengths of a diagram with a single
row (or a single column) is `μ.card !`.

The arm, the leg and the hook of a cell `c` are cut out of `μ`, so all three are empty apart from
`c` itself when `c ∉ μ`; in that case `hookLength μ c = 1`.  The lemmas below that would be false
for such a junk value carry the hypothesis `c ∈ μ` explicitly.

## Main definitions

* `YoungDiagram.hook`: the hook of a cell, as a `Finset (ℕ × ℕ)`.
* `YoungDiagram.hookLength`: the hook length of a cell, `armLength + legLength + 1`.

## Main results

* `YoungDiagram.card_hook`: the hook of a cell has `hookLength` many elements.
* `YoungDiagram.hookLength_transpose`: transposition preserves hook lengths.
* `YoungDiagram.hookLength_eq_one_iff`: a cell has hook length `1` exactly when neither the
  cell to its right nor the cell below it lies in the diagram; for a cell of the diagram this says
  that it is a corner, which is `YoungDiagram.isCorner_iff_hookLength_eq_one`.
* `YoungDiagram.prod_hookLength_eq_factorial_of_colLen_le_one`: the hook lengths of a
  one-row diagram multiply to `μ.card !`.

  `standardCount μ * ∏ c ∈ μ.cells, hookLength μ c = μ.card !` is stated in terms of Layer 0's
  `standardCount`, so nothing here depends on the Specht modules of Layer 3; the Specht-module
  dimension form is a derived corollary of Layer 5's separate standard-basis target.

/-! ### Diagrams with a single row or a single column

A Young diagram `μ` has at most one row exactly when `μ.colLen 0 ≤ 1`.  Its hook lengths are then
`μ.card, μ.card - 1, …, 1`, so they multiply to `μ.card !`; the one-column case follows by
transposition.  These are the two instances of the multiplicative hook-length formula
`standardCount μ * ∏ c ∈ μ.cells, hookLength μ c = μ.card !` in which the number of standard Young
tableaux is `1`; that count is not computed here.  The shapes themselves are described in
`TauCeti/Combinatorics/Young/Diagram.lean`, by `YoungDiagram.cells_eq_of_colLen_le_one` and
`YoungDiagram.card_eq_rowLen_of_colLen_le_one`. -/

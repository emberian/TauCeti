# Order properties of semistandard Young tableaux

Mathlib's `SemistandardYoungTableau` records that entries increase weakly along each row and
strictly down each column, each within a single row or column. This file combines the two into the
two-dimensional statement that consumers actually reach for, comparing entries that differ in both
coordinates at once: an entry is bounded by any entry weakly below and to the right of it.

The material is deliberately kept in its own module, upstream of the contents and Kostka-number
theory, so that a basic order fact about tableaux does not oblige a consumer to import that
theory.

## Main declarations

* `SemistandardYoungTableau.entry_le_of_le`: entries increase weakly to the right and downwards.

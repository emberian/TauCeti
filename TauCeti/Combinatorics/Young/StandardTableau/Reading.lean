# Reading order, the superstandard tableaux, and the shapes with a unique standard tableau

Numbering the cells of a Young diagram `μ` in *reading order* -- left to right along the first
row, then left to right along the second, and so on -- labels the cell `(i, j)` by
`YoungDiagram.readingIndex μ (i, j) = μ.rowLen 0 + ⋯ + μ.rowLen (i - 1) + j`.  Reading
order increases along rows and down columns, so this labelling is a standard Young tableau, the
**row-superstandard tableau** `TauCeti.StandardYoungTableau.rowSuperstandard μ`; in particular
`TauCeti.standardCount μ`, the number `f^μ` of standard Young tableaux, is never zero.

Numbering the cells column by column instead gives a second standard Young tableau
`TauCeti.StandardYoungTableau.colSuperstandard μ`, the transpose of the row-superstandard tableau
of the transposed diagram.  The two disagree as soon as `μ` has a cell outside its first row *and*
a cell outside its first column, while a diagram with at most one row, or with at most one column
-- the empty diagram included -- has only one standard Young tableau at all.  So `f^μ = 1` holds
exactly for the diagrams with at most one row and those with at most one column.

Those are also exactly the shapes whose hook lengths are already known to multiply to `μ.card !`,
by `YoungDiagram.prod_hookLength_eq_factorial_of_colLen_le_one` and its transpose, so the
multiplicative hook-length formula `f^μ · ∏_{c ∈ μ} hookLength μ c = μ.card !` follows for them.

## Main definitions

* `YoungDiagram.readingIndex`: the position of a cell in reading order.
* `TauCeti.StandardYoungTableau.rowSuperstandard`: the tableau numbering the cells row by row.
* `TauCeti.StandardYoungTableau.colSuperstandard`: the tableau numbering the cells column by
  column.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.standardCount_pos`: every Young diagram has a standard Young tableau.
* `TauCeti.standardCount_eq_one_iff`: a Young diagram has exactly one standard Young tableau
  precisely when it has at most one row or at most one column, the empty diagram included.
* `TauCeti.standardCount_mul_prod_hookLength_of_standardCount_eq_one`: the multiplicative
  hook-length formula for the diagrams with a unique standard Young tableau, together with its
  specialisations `TauCeti.standardCount_mul_prod_hookLength_of_colLen_le_one` and
  `TauCeti.standardCount_mul_prod_hookLength_of_rowLen_le_one` to the diagrams with at most one
  row and to those with at most one column.

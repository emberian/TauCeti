# Paths in acyclic simple graphs

This file records reusable consequences of acyclicity for paths in simple graphs.

## Main results

* `SimpleGraph.IsAcyclic.not_adj_getVert_of_add_one_lt`: nonconsecutive vertices of a path
  in an acyclic graph are not adjacent.
* `SimpleGraph.IsAcyclic.ne_of_adj_start_of_adj_end`: an off-path neighbour of a path's start
  differs from every neighbour of its end.
* `SimpleGraph.IsAcyclic.not_adj_of_adj_start_of_adj_end`: when both lie off the path, such a
  neighbour of the start and a neighbour of the end are not adjacent.

/-- **Neighbours of a path's two ends, both lying off the path, are not adjacent.** In an acyclic

both are required to lie off the path, unlike in `ne_of_adj_start_of_adj_end`. -/

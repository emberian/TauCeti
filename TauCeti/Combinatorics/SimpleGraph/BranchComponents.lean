# Components left by deleting a branch vertex of a tree

Deleting a vertex `c` from a tree separates it into one component for each neighbour of `c`.
When every vertex of the complement has degree at most two there, the resulting components are
paths.  This is the graph-theoretic extraction step behind the `D` and `E` branches of the
finite-type Dynkin-diagram classification.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsTree.neighborSetEquivConnectedComponentCompl`: the neighbours of a vertex index the
  connected components left after deleting that vertex from a tree.
* `TauCeti.IsTree.exists_equiv_pathGraph_components`: deleting a vertex of degree `n` from a finite
  tree leaves `n` components, each a path when the complement has degree at most two.

## References

See J. E. Humphreys, *Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory*, Section 11.4, for
the corresponding extraction in the classification of Dynkin diagrams.

/-- **Deleting a vertex of degree `n` from a finite tree leaves `n` components, and they are paths
as soon as the complement has degree at most two.**

The equivalence `e` records which component begins at each neighbour of `c`.  The second conclusion
is deliberately componentwise: each component carries its own natural path length, which is the arm
length used in the subsequent reindexing onto a star. -/

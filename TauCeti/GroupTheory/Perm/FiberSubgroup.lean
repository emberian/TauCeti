# Permutations preserving the fibers of a map

Given `f : α → ι`, the permutations `σ` of `α` with `f (σ a) = f a` for every `a` form a subgroup
of `Equiv.Perm α`, here called `TauCeti.fiberSubgroup f`.  This file records that subgroup, the
transpositions it contains, the behaviour of the construction under conjugation and pairing two
maps, the criterion for it to be trivial, and the isomorphism restricting a fiber-preserving
permutation to each fiber,

`fiberSubgroup f ≃* ∀ i, Equiv.Perm {a // f a = i}`,

together with the two formulas reading that isomorphism, and its inverse, through a family of
equivalences `{a // f a = i} ≃ β i` of the fibers, which is how a concrete description of the
fibers is fed into it.

Mathlib already studies these permutations, but through the domain action of `Equiv.Perm α` on
`α → ι`: `DomMulAct.stabilizerMulEquiv` is the same isomorphism stated on
`(MulAction.stabilizer (Equiv.Perm α)ᵈᵐᵃ f)ᵐᵒᵖ`.  The `ᵈᵐᵃ`/`ᵐᵒᵖ` wrapping makes it awkward to use
where the object of interest is a subgroup of `Equiv.Perm α` itself, as it is for the row and
column groups of a Young tableau; `fiberSubgroup` is that subgroup.  The two presentations are
identified by `fiberSubgroupMulEquivStabilizer`, and the isomorphism above is Mathlib's
`DomMulAct.stabilizerMulEquiv` transported along it.

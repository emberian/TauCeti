# A transcribed presentation of the Harada--Norton group

This file carries the `HN` row of the sporadic presentation data required by milestone S1 of
`TauCetiRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md`. It records the corrected five-generator presentation of
the Harada--Norton group given by Bray and Curtis as a `TauCeti.GroupPresentation`, together with
its source, generator convention, transcription notes, and expected counts.

The nineteen relators are

```text
a⁴, [a²,b], b⁷, (ab²)⁴, a⁻²(abab³)³, ((ab)³ab⁻³)²,
c²a², [a,c], [bab,c], (bab³c)³,
d², (ad)², [b,d], d^(cbcb⁻¹)(cd)³,
t⁵, t^a t², t^c t⁻², [t,b], (dt)³.
```

Here `[r,s] = r⁻¹s⁻¹rs` and `r^s = s⁻¹rs`, following the Magma source. Mathlib's
`commutatorElement` uses the opposite commutator convention, so a source commutator is represented
by `Relator.comm (.inv r) (.inv s)`. Conjugates are expanded directly in the structured
expressions. The proved `TauCeti.Relator.toWord_toFreeGroup` theorem is the audit boundary between
these expressions and the signed words consumed by `PresentedGroup`.

Section 4 of Bray--Curtis constructs `HN` as a quotient of a progenitor by coset enumeration over
the visible subgroup `2·HS:2`. Section 5 derives the five-generator presentation used here. The
authors' corrected Magma file `HNpb.m` gives the same nineteen relators exactly; in particular, it
uses `(ad)²`, correcting the preprint's `[a,d]` at that position. The source describes `c` and `d`
as generators adjoined while successively presenting `U₃(5):2` and `HS:2`, and `t` as the
order-five symmetric generator whose final relations produce `HN`.

The source-to-Lean transcription has been read against both the corrected printed display and the
machine-readable Magma file. An independent read-through remains part of the S1 review artifact.
This file asserts no order, finiteness, simplicity, or identification result.

The row's body is sealed, so this is the equation that characterizes it: with
`TauCeti.GroupPresentation.relators_def` it determines the compiled words, and with
`TauCeti.GroupPresentation.mem_relatorSet_iff` it determines the relations defining
`TauCeti.GroupPresentation.Group`, so a consumer auditing the transcription never has to unfold the
row. Indices `0` through `4` are the generators `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` and `t`, and their bounds come

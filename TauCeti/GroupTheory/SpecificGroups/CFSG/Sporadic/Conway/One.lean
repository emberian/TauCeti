# A transcribed presentation of the first Conway group

This file carries the `Co₁` row of the sporadic presentation data required by milestone S1 of
`TauCetiRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md`. It records presentation `GPLTable.Co1.1` from Roderik
Lindenbergh's Group Presentations Library as a `TauCeti.GroupPresentation`, together with the exact
source, generator convention, transcription notes, expected counts, and decidable checks on the
transcription.

The presentation uses the Coxeter graph encoded by

```text
b4h3a3b5c3d3f4c3e4a, b4g4f, e6f6h.
```

All eight generators are involutions and every omitted edge has label two. Thus the graph
contributes eight square relations, thirteen labeled-edge relations, and fifteen omitted-edge
relations. The source then appends

```text
a = (cf)²,  e = (bg)²,  b = (ef)³,  d = (bh)²,  d = (eah)³,
(adfh)³,  (baefg)³,  (cef)⁷,  (adefcefgh)³⁹.
```

An equality `x = y` in the source is the relator `x⁻¹y`. The complete presentation therefore has
45 relators, whose compiled words have 611 signed letters. The theorems below check both figures
from the transcribed expressions.

The library identifies this record as a presentation of `Co₁` originating in Praeger--Soicher,
whose construction uses low-rank representations and graphs for sporadic groups. The stored data
is a full presentation of the abstract group, not a semi-presentation for recognizing generators
in an already constructed group. This file asserts no order, finiteness, simplicity, or
identification result. A separate source-to-Lean read-through remains part of the S1 review artifact
required by the roadmap.

Each alternative is dispatched by the shape of its relator, not by goal position: a relator that
is a power is checked on its base through `TauCeti.Relator.isCyclicallyReduced_toWord_pow`, and
every other relator is checked by direct computation, so inserting, removing, or reordering
relators cannot redirect a branch. The power route is also what makes the last relator tractable
at all: it is a thirty-ninth power whose expansion has three hundred and fifty-one of the
presentation's letters, and expanding it exhausts the elaborator. -/

# A transcribed presentation of the first Fischer group

This file carries the `Fi₂₂` row of the sporadic presentation data required by milestone S1 of
`TauCetiRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md`. It records the ATLAS presentation on the standard
generators `a` and `b` as a `TauCeti.GroupPresentation`, together with its exact source, generator
convention, transcription notes, expected counts, and the decidable count check.

The thirteen relators are

```text
a², b¹³, (ab)¹¹, (ab²)²¹,
[a,b]³, [a,b²]³, [a,b³]³, [a,b⁴]², [a,b⁵]³,
[a,bab²]³, [a,b⁻¹ab⁻²]², [a,bab⁵]², [a,b²ab⁵]².
```

The source's commutator convention is `[r,s] = r⁻¹s⁻¹rs`, opposite to Mathlib's
`commutatorElement`, so each commutator is stored as `Relator.comm (.inv r) (.inv s)` as
`TauCeti.Relator` prescribes. The proved `TauCeti.Relator.toWord_toFreeGroup` is the audit boundary
between these expressions and the signed words consumed by `PresentedGroup`.

The presentation source is backed by a computation for the double cover `2·Fi₂₂`. Its twelve
base relators present the double cover, with central involution represented by both `(ab²)²¹` and
`(ab ab ab⁻³)⁵`; adjoining either as a relator kills that involution and gives `Fi₂₂`. The ATLAS
source records that the coset enumeration over the displayed involution centralizer works with
either choice, while the version 3 presentation page chooses `(ab²)²¹` as transcribed here.

As an independent check, GAP 4.15.1 with AtlasRep 2.1.9 evaluates all thirteen displayed relators
to the identity on the ATLAS standard generators in the 3510-point permutation representation of
`Fi₂₂`. This is transcription provenance rather than a Lean theorem: the file asserts no order,
finiteness, simplicity, or identification result. A separate read-through against the
`FiniteSimpleGroups` development named by the roadmap remains part of the S1 review artifact.

/-- The ATLAS finite presentation of the Fischer group `Fi₂₂` on its standard generators `a`

The ATLAS lists this as a presentation of the abstract group, separately from the relations used
only to recognize standard generators inside an existing group. No structural property of the
presented group is asserted here: this definition records only the cited generators and relators.

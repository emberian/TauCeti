# A transcribed presentation of the Baby Monster

This file carries the `B` row of the sporadic presentation data required by milestone S1 of
`TauCetiRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md`. It records the `Y₄₃₃` presentation of the Baby Monster
as a `TauCeti.GroupPresentation`, together with the diagram it expands, the exact source, the
generator convention, the transcription notes, and decidable checks on the transcribed data.

The eleven involutory generators are the nodes of a `Y`-shaped Coxeter diagram: a chain of eight
nodes with a further arm of three nodes attached to its fifth node,

```text
t₁ -- t₂ -- t₃ -- t₄ -- t₅ -- t₆ -- t₇ -- t₈
                        |
                        t₉ -- t₁₀ -- t₁₁
```

so that the branch node `t₅` carries three arms, of lengths four, three and three; this is what the
name `Y₄₃₃` records. The Coxeter relations contribute `11` square relators and one relator
`(tᵢ tⱼ) ^ m` for each of the `55` unordered pairs of distinct nodes, with `m = 3` on the ten edges
and `m = 2` off them. Adjoining the spider relation

```text
(t₅ t₄ t₃ t₅ t₆ t₇ t₅ t₉ t₁₀) ^ 10 = 1
```

presents `2 × 2·B`, and adjoining the two further relations

```text
(t₅ t₄ t₃ t₆ t₇ t₈ t₉) ^ 9 = 1,      (t₅ t₄ t₃ t₆ t₉ t₁₀ t₁₁) ^ 9 = 1
```

presents the Baby Monster itself. The `69` relators are therefore `66 + 1 + 2`.

The source is admissible in the sense the roadmap requires: it presents the abstract group rather
than recognizing generators inside a group constructed elsewhere. The presentation was conjectured
in the ATLAS of Finite Groups and proved by Ivanov, subject to the Monster having no proper double
cover; that hypothesis is Griess's determination of the Schur multiplier of the Monster. The row
below records that chain of attributions rather than reproving any part of it.

Nothing here asserts that the presented group is nontrivial, finite or simple, that it has any
particular order, or that it is isomorphic to any other construction of the Baby Monster. The
roadmap's independent permutation-group cross-check does not cover `B`, whose smallest faithful
permutation representation has degree `13 571 955 000`, so for this row an independent
source-to-Lean read-through remains the whole of the S1 review obligation.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.arms` and `TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.edges`: the three arms of
  the `Y₄₃₃` diagram and the edges they contribute.
* `TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.coxeterMatrix`: the Coxeter matrix of the numbered diagram.
* `TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.spiderRelator`: the spider relation of the source.
* `TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.extraRelatorOne` and
  `TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.extraRelatorTwo`: the two further relations the source adjoins to
  pass from `2 × 2·B` to `B`.
* `TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.presentation`: the transcribed row.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.map_length_neighbors`: the degree sequence of the transcribed
  diagram, a check consistent with the published `Y`-shape; `edges_eq` and `map_length_arms` pin
  the shape itself.
* `TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.length_relatorList` and
  `TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.matchesMetadata_presentation`: the transcription count checks.
* `TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.mulEquivPresentedGroupCoxeterAppend`: the row presents the Coxeter
  group of the diagram cut down by the three adjoined relations, which is the shape of the source's
  statement.

/-! ### The numbered `Y₄₃₃` diagram

The source numbers its involutions `t₁` to `t₁₁`; the relator index `Fin 11` follows that
numbering with the customary offset, so `tᵢ` is index `i - 1`. -/

records. -/

/-- The branch node and the arms use every node, so with
`TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.nodup_branchNode_cons_flatten_arms` each generator of the
presentation occupies exactly one position of the diagram. -/
theorem mem_branchNode_cons_flatten_arms (i : Fin 11) : i ∈ branchNode :: arms.flatten := by

/-- The edges of the diagram: each arm contributes the edge joining it to the branch node and an
edge between each pair of nodes consecutive along it. Pairs are oriented outwards; the Coxeter
matrix below reads them symmetrically. -/
def edges : List (Fin 11 × Fin 11) := arms.flatMap fun arm => (branchNode :: arm).zip arm

/-- The ten edges of the numbered diagram, written out.

Read with the offset `tᵢ ↦ i - 1`, these are the source's ten adjacent pairs
`(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,7), (7,8), (5,9), (9,10), (10,11)`. The first arm's four
edges appear in reverse order and reverse orientation because that arm is listed outwards from the

neighbors; the three arm ends `t₁`, `t₈` and `t₁₁`, that is indices `0`, `7` and `10`, have one
each; and the remaining seven nodes have two each. Thus the matrix that the relators are built from
has a degree sequence consistent with the `Y`-shape. The shape itself is pinned by `edges_eq`
together with `map_length_arms` and `nodup_branchNode_cons_flatten_arms`, from which the edges are
built. -/

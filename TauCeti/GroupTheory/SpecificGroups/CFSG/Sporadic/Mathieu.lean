# Transcribed presentations of the Mathieu groups `M₁₁`, `M₁₂` and `M₂₂`

This file carries three rows of the sporadic presentation manifest: cited finite presentations of
the Mathieu groups `M₁₁`, `M₁₂` and `M₂₂`, transcribed from published sources in which each
presentation is *proved* to define the named group. Each row is a `TauCeti.GroupPresentation`, so it
records the generator names, the source and a locator inside it, the generator convention, the
transcription notes, and the generator and relator counts stated by the source, together with the
relator expressions themselves.

Four decidable checks accompany every row. The first is the generator and relator counts. The second
spells the compiled words out letter by letter, so that a reviewer comparing the Lean data with the
source never has to unfold the relator compiler. The third reads off from those letters the total
number of them, against the length published by the source. The fourth is that every compiled word
is cyclically reduced, which is what makes the letter count comparable with a published length: both
sources measure length after free and cyclic reduction of each relator.

The rows themselves are sealed definitions, so each also carries the equation that characterizes it,
spelling out its transcribed relator expressions with their generator indices. Together with
`TauCeti.GroupPresentation.relators_def` and `TauCeti.GroupPresentation.mem_relatorSet_iff`, and
with the interpretation equations of `TauCeti.Relator.toFreeGroup`, that equation determines the
compiled words and the relations defining the presented group, so a consumer downstream of this
file reasons about a row without unfolding it. Each row likewise publishes an equation for every
one of its metadata fields — the source, the locator, the generator convention, the transcription
notes and the two counts the source states — so an audit downstream sees the provenance a manifest
row exists to record, and not merely the row's name.

## The manifest rows

| Name | Source | Locator | Generators | Relators | Length |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `M₁₁` | Campbell--Havas--Ramsay--Robertson | Table 2 row `M11`, Section 5.8 | 2 | 2 | 19 |
| `M₁₂` | Campbell--Havas--Ramsay--Robertson | Table 2 row `M12`, Section 5.17 | 2 | 3 | 29 |
| `M₂₂` | Conder--Havas--Ramsay | Section 3.4, p. 40 | 2 | 3 | 30 |

Both sources prove their presentations by coset enumeration over the trivial subgroup, and both
record the number of cosets that the enumeration used; those figures are part of the transcription
notes of each row. Each row is also an *efficient* presentation in the sense of its source, meaning
that its deficiency attains the lower bound coming from the Schur multiplier; that is the property
the sources are about, and it plays no role here beyond explaining why they list these words.

## What is and is not claimed

Nothing in this file asserts that the presented groups are nontrivial, finite, or simple, that they
have any particular order, or that they are isomorphic to any other construction of a Mathieu
group. Those are downstream statements which the CFSG roadmap deliberately does not ask for. What is
proved here is exactly the transcription arithmetic: the counts, the total length, the compiled
letters, and cyclic reducedness.

## Cross-checks

The correctness of a transcription is a review obligation, not something these theorems establish.
Two external checks are recorded below as provenance for a reviewer. Neither is a Lean proof, and
neither is claimed by any theorem in this file.

The first is an independent re-enumeration of the transcribed words outside Lean, with GAP 4.15.1.
Transcribing the compiled letters back into GAP's free-group syntax gives the input

```text
F := FreeGroup("a", "b");;  a := F.1;;  b := F.2;;
G11 := F / [ b*a^-3*b*a^-1*b^3, b*a*b^-1*a^-1*b^-1*a^-1*b*a*b^-1*a ];;
G12 := F / [ (b^-1*a)^3, a^5*b^6, a*b^2*a*b^-1*a^2*b*a^2*b^2 ];;
G22 := F / [ a^4*b*a^-1*b*a^-1*b, a^2*b*a^-1*b^-1*a*b^2*a^-1*b^-1, b^11 ];;
List([G11, G12, G22], Size);
List([G11, G12, G22], IsSimpleGroup);
List([[G11, 11], [G12, 12], [G22, 22]], p -> IsomorphismGroups(p[1], MathieuGroup(p[2])) <> fail);
```

on which Todd--Coxeter over the trivial subgroup returns the orders `7920`, `95040` and `443520`,
each group is simple, and an isomorphism to `MathieuGroup(11)`, `MathieuGroup(12)` and
`MathieuGroup(22)` is found. That reproduces the published claim about the words as transcribed
here, and a mistyped letter would be very unlikely to survive it.

The second is the comparison the CFSG roadmap asks a sporadic row to record, and these three rows
still owe it. The roadmap points at the Lean 4 permutation-group development
[FiniteSimpleGroups](https://github.com/KitaKen1/finite-simple-groups-lean), which builds `M₁₁`,
`M₁₂` and `M₂₂` as subgroups of `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` with their orders and simplicity proved, and
asks whether the transcribed relators hold of its named generators. That is a review artifact rather
than a Lean target, since making it one would mean importing that development, which the roadmap
conditions on coordination with its author. It has not been carried out for these rows, and the GAP
re-enumeration above is an additional independent check rather than a substitute for it.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Sporadic.m11Presentation`, `TauCeti.Sporadic.m12Presentation` and
  `TauCeti.Sporadic.m22Presentation`: the three transcribed rows.

## References

This is part of milestone S1 of `TauCetiRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md`, which asks for a complete
relator word list, with an admissible source, for each of the twenty-six sporadic names. It
populates the presentation data for three of those rows; the rows remain open until the required
comparisons against the FiniteSimpleGroups development are recorded. The two sources are:

* C. M. Campbell, G. Havas, C. Ramsay and E. F. Robertson, *Nice efficient presentations for all
  small simple groups and their covers*, LMS J. Comput. Math. **7** (2004), 266--283,
  <https://doi.org/10.1112/S1461157000001121>;
* M. D. E. Conder, G. Havas and C. Ramsay, *Efficient presentations for the Mathieu simple group
  `M₂₂` and its cover*, in *Finite Geometries, Groups, and Computation*, Walter de Gruyter, Berlin,
  2006, 33--41.

The Lean development named in the cross-check above is
[FiniteSimpleGroups](https://github.com/KitaKen1/finite-simple-groups-lean); nothing from it is
imported, copied, or adapted here.

The remaining two Mathieu names, `M₂₃` and `M₂₄`, are not transcribed here. The presentations on
their ATLAS version 3 pages are stated rather than proved there, and locating a source that proves
them is part of the S0 search that milestone still owes those rows.

/-! ### The alphabet of a two-generator presentation

Both sources write relators as words in two generators `a` and `b`, with an upper-case letter
denoting an inverse, so that `A` is `a⁻¹`. The four expressions below are those four letters, and
`⬝` below is `TauCeti.Relator.mul`, so a transcribed relator reads left to right exactly as the
source prints it. -/

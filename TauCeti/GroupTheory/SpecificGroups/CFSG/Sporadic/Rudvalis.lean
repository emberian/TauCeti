# A transcribed presentation of the Rudvalis group

This file carries the `Ru` row of the sporadic presentation data required by milestone S1 of
`TauCetiRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md`. It records Leonard Soicher's `tcenum` presentation of
the Rudvalis group as a `TauCeti.GroupPresentation`, together with its exact source, generator
convention, transcription notes, expected counts, and decidable checks on the transcription.

The complete presentation is

```text
⟨u, v, t | v², t², u⁴, (uv)⁷, (u²v)³, [t,vuv], [t,u⁻¹vu],
           (ut)¹⁰, (uvut)¹³,
           (u[t,u⁻¹][u⁻²tu²,[u⁻¹,t]])³,
           (u(uv)⁻¹t(uv)(tu²)⁴(uv)⁻¹tuv)²,
           (uvtv[(uv)⁻¹tuv,u]²)² ⟩,
```

where `[r,s] = r⁻¹s⁻¹rs`. Bradley, Curtis, and Malik deduce an ordinary presentation
from their symmetric construction of `Ru`; Soicher's `tcenum` artifact supplies the exact list
above and cites that paper as its reference.

The `tcenum` format has five sections. Its first two sections list all generators `uvt` and mark
only `u` as not known to be an involution, which contributes the implicit relators `v²` and `t²`.
The third section lists generators of the subgroup used for coset enumeration and contributes no
relator. The fourth section is empty, so it contributes no Coxeter relations. The ten words in the
fifth section are the remaining relators. The source's parser expands a commutator as
`r⁻¹s⁻¹rs`, so source commutators are represented using `Relator.comm (.inv r) (.inv s)`.
The proved `TauCeti.Relator.toWord_toFreeGroup` theorem is the audit boundary between these
structured expressions and the signed words used by `PresentedGroup`.

The source artifact also gives subgroup generators for enumeration over `²F₄(2)`. They are not
part of the abstract presentation and are therefore recorded in the metadata but not inserted as
relations. This file asserts no order, finiteness, simplicity, or identification result. A separate
source-to-Lean read-through remains part of the S1 review artifact required by the roadmap.

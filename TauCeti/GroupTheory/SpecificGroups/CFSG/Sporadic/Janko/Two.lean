# A transcribed presentation of the second Janko group

This file carries the `J₂` row of the sporadic presentation manifest required by milestone S1 of
`TauCetiRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md`. It records a published two-generator, three-relator
presentation in `TauCeti.GroupPresentation`, including its exact source, generator convention,
transcription notes, and expected counts.

The presentation is the `n = 7`, order `604800` entry in Section 3 of Stoytchev's paper. In the
source's notation it is

```text
⟨a, b | aba = bab,
         ab²a = b⁵,
         (ab⁻¹ab⁻³a³b⁻¹)³a⁷ = 1⟩.
```

The source writes the exponent in the last relation as `±3`, thereby giving two presentations; this
file chooses the displayed positive exponent. Equalities are transcribed as relators by multiplying
the left-hand side by the inverse of the right-hand side. Thus the first two compiled words are
`a b a B A B` and `a b b a B B B B B`, where capitals denote inverses.

## Checks

The generator and relator counts are checked by `j2Presentation_matchesMetadata`. The stored
expressions preserve the source's powers and display each relation in the same left-to-right order;
`Relator.toWord_toFreeGroup` is the already-proved audit boundary from those expressions to the
signed words used by `PresentedGroup`.

As an independent transcription check, the exact three relators below were enumerated with GAP
4.15.1 over the trivial subgroup; the resulting finitely presented group has order `604800`,
agreeing with both the paper and GAP's Atlas group `J2`. This computation is provenance for the
transcription, not a Lean theorem, and this file asserts no order, finiteness, simplicity, or
identification result.

The source obtains this presentation by enumerating the finitely presented group and checking that
the group of order `604800` is simple. No such structural property is asserted here: this definition

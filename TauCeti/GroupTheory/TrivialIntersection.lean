# Trivial-intersection subgroups and Frobenius complements

A subgroup `H` of `G` is a **trivial-intersection subgroup** when it meets each of its distinct
conjugates trivially: `H ⊓ g H g⁻¹ = ⊥` whenever `g ∉ H`.  Equivalently `H` is *malnormal*: a
nonidentity element of `H` is conjugated out of `H` by every `g ∉ H`.  A **Frobenius complement**
is such a subgroup that is in addition proper and nontrivial, and `G` is then called a Frobenius
group with complement `H`.

The elementwise form is the definition taken here, because it is what every proof uses; the
lattice form is `TauCeti.isTISubgroup_iff_inf_conj_smul_eq_bot`.

Alongside the subgroup notion there is a set-level one.  A **trivial-intersection set** for `H` is
a subset `S ⊆ H` normalized by `H` whose distinct `G`-conjugates are pairwise disjoint.  The
example that matters is the nonidentity part `H# = (H : Set G) \ {1}` of a Frobenius complement
(`TauCeti.IsFrobeniusComplement.isTISet_diff_one`): a class function on `H` supported on such an
`S` induces to `G` without changing its norm, as long as the order of `G` is invertible in the
coefficient field `k` (`IsUnit (Nat.card G : k)`, as everywhere in this theory, because induction
divides by that order).  That is the input to the exceptional-character argument for Frobenius's
theorem.  That induction statement is
`TauCeti.characterPairing_ind_ind_of_isTISet`, in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Induction/TrivialIntersection.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsTISubgroup`: `H` meets each of its distinct conjugates trivially.
* `TauCeti.IsTISet`: `S` is a trivial-intersection set relative to `H`.
* `TauCeti.IsFrobeniusComplement`: `H` is a proper nontrivial trivial-intersection subgroup.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isTISubgroup_iff_inf_conj_smul_eq_bot`: the lattice form of the definition.
* `TauCeti.IsTISubgroup.normalizer_eq_self`: a nontrivial trivial-intersection subgroup is
  self-normalizing.
* `TauCeti.IsTISubgroup.isTISet`: an `H`-invariant subset of `H` avoiding the identity is a
  trivial-intersection set, and in particular so is the nonidentity part of `H`.
* `TauCeti.IsTISet.one_notMem`: conversely, a trivial-intersection set for a proper subgroup
  avoids the identity.

/-! ### Trivial-intersection subgroups -/

/-- **A trivial-intersection subgroup**: `H` meets each of its distinct conjugates trivially.
Stated elementwise, as the malnormality condition that only the identity of `H` can be conjugated
back into `H` by an element outside `H`; `TauCeti.isTISubgroup_iff_inf_conj_smul_eq_bot` is the
equivalent statement `H ⊓ g H g⁻¹ = ⊥` about the subgroup lattice. -/

    g * x * g⁻¹ ∉ H :=
  fun h => hx1 (hH hg hx h)

/-- **A nontrivial trivial-intersection subgroup is self-normalizing.**  An element of the
normalizer conjugates a chosen nonidentity element of `H` back into `H`, so it cannot lie outside
`H`. -/

/-- **The lattice form of the trivial-intersection condition**: `H` meets each conjugate
`g H g⁻¹` with `g ∉ H` in the trivial subgroup.  This is how the condition is usually written; the
elementwise `TauCeti.IsTISubgroup` is the form the proofs use. -/

/-! ### Trivial-intersection sets -/

/-- **A trivial-intersection set** for `H`: a subset of `H`, normalized by `H`, whose
`G`-conjugates by elements outside `H` are disjoint from it.  Since conjugation by an element of
`H` fixes `S`, the conjugates of `S` are indexed by the cosets of `H`, and the condition says that
the distinct ones are pairwise disjoint.

The motivating example is the nonidentity part `(H : Set G) \ {1}` of a trivial-intersection
subgroup (`TauCeti.IsTISubgroup.isTISet_diff_one`). -/
structure IsTISet (S : Set G) (H : Subgroup G) : Prop where
  /-- A trivial-intersection set is contained in its subgroup. -/

  /-- A trivial-intersection set is normalized by its subgroup. -/

  /-- Conjugating a trivial-intersection set by an element outside its subgroup moves it off
  itself. -/
  disjoint_conj : ∀ g : G, g ∉ H → ∀ x ∈ S, g * x * g⁻¹ ∉ S

namespace IsTISet

/-- The image of a trivial-intersection set under conjugation by an element of its subgroup is the
set itself; the two inclusions come from `TauCeti.IsTISet.conj_mem` at `h` and at `h⁻¹`. -/

notion refers to. -/

fixed by every conjugation, so it could not be moved off the set. -/

end IsTISet

/-- **An `H`-invariant subset of `H` avoiding the identity is a trivial-intersection set.**  This
is where the trivial-intersection condition on the subgroup does the work: an element of `S`
conjugated by some `g ∉ H` back into `H` would have to be the identity. -/

/-! ### Frobenius complements -/

/-- **A Frobenius complement**: a proper, nontrivial trivial-intersection subgroup.  A group with
such a subgroup is a *Frobenius group* with complement `H`; Frobenius's theorem says that the
elements lying in no conjugate of `H`, together with the identity, form a normal complement to
`H`. -/

  /-- A Frobenius complement is nontrivial. -/

/-- **A Frobenius complement is not normal.**  It is self-normalizing and proper, so its
normalizer is not the whole group. -/

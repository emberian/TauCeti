# Elementary and hyperelementary groups

Fix a natural number `p`. A group is **`p`-elementary** when it is the internal direct product of a
cyclic subgroup of order prime to `p` and a `p`-subgroup, and **`p`-hyperelementary** when it has a
cyclic normal subgroup of order prime to `p` whose quotient is a `p`-group; a group is
**elementary** (respectively **hyperelementary**) when it is `p`-elementary (respectively
`p`-hyperelementary) for some prime `p`. Mathlib has `IsCyclic` and `IsPGroup` but no predicate
built from them in this shape, so this file supplies the two definitions together with the closure
properties they are used through.

The definitions are the ones Brauer's induction theorem is stated against: Artin's theorem writes a
character as a rational combination of characters induced from *cyclic* subgroups, and Brauer's
sharpens this to an integral combination of characters induced from *elementary* subgroups. That
the elementary groups include the cyclic ones is the content of
`TauCeti.isPElementary_of_isCyclic` below: a finite cyclic group is `p`-elementary for **every**
prime `p`, by splitting it as the product of its `p`-part and its `p'`-part.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsPElementary p G`: `G` is the internal direct product of a cyclic subgroup of order
  prime to `p` and a `p`-subgroup.
* `TauCeti.IsPHyperelementary p G`: `G` has a cyclic normal subgroup of order prime to `p` with
  `p`-group quotient.
* `TauCeti.IsElementary G`, `TauCeti.IsHyperelementary G`: the same, for some prime `p`.

Each of the four predicates is restated as an `Iff` by `TauCeti.isPElementary_def`,
`TauCeti.isPHyperelementary_def`, `TauCeti.isElementary_def` and `TauCeti.isHyperelementary_def`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isPElementary_of_isCyclic`: every finite cyclic group is `p`-elementary, for every
  prime `p`; hence `TauCeti.isElementary_of_isCyclic`, cyclic groups are elementary.
* `TauCeti.IsPElementary.isPHyperelementary`: `p`-elementary groups are `p`-hyperelementary.
* `TauCeti.IsPElementary.of_injective`, `TauCeti.IsPHyperelementary.of_injective`: both classes are
  closed under passing to a subgroup, in the form of an injective homomorphism into the group. The
  subgroup forms are `TauCeti.IsPElementary.subgroup` and `TauCeti.IsPHyperelementary.subgroup`.
* `TauCeti.IsHyperelementary.isSolvable`: a finite hyperelementary group is solvable, whence
  `TauCeti.not_isElementary_perm_fin_5`, the symmetric group on five letters is not elementary.

## Implementation notes

The `p`-group condition on the quotient in `TauCeti.IsPHyperelementary` is spelled out elementwise,
as `∀ g, ∃ k, g ^ p ^ k ∈ C`, rather than as `IsPGroup p (G ⧸ C)`. The two are equivalent
(`TauCeti.isPHyperelementary_iff_isPGroup_quotient`, and the two implications it is assembled from,
`TauCeti.isPGroup_quotient_of_forall_exists_pow_mem` and
`TauCeti.isPHyperelementary_of_isPGroup_quotient`), but the quotient `G ⧸ C` is a group only once
the normality of `C` is available as an instance, which an existential quantifier inside the
definition cannot supply. The elementwise form keeps the definition free of that bookkeeping and is
also the form the closure proofs use directly.

`TauCeti.IsPElementary` records the internal direct product decomposition as
`Subgroup.IsComplement'` together with elementwise commutation, rather than as normality of both
factors: this is the form the proofs consume, and normality of the cyclic factor is derived from it
in `TauCeti.normal_of_commute_of_sup_eq_top`.

## References

This supplies a prerequisite for
`TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/InductionRestriction/README.md`,
Layer 6 ("Elementary and hyperelementary subgroups"), which asks for exactly these two predicates
"from these orientations, with their basic closure properties", as the indexing sets of Artin's and
Brauer's induction theorems.

/-! ### Restating the definitions

The four definitions above are `public` but not `@[expose]`, so downstream modules see their
statements and not their bodies: neither `unfold IsPElementary` nor `simp only [IsPElementary]`
is available there. The `Iff.rfl` lemmas in this section are therefore the only way to eliminate
the predicates outside this file, as `Subgroup.isComplement'_def` is for `Subgroup.IsComplement'`
and `isPrimePow_def` is for `IsPrimePow`.

/-- A finite cyclic group is `p`-elementary for **every** prime `p`: writing `Nat.card G` as
`p ^ a * m` with `p ∤ m` and taking a generator `g`, the subgroup generated by `g ^ (p ^ a)` is
cyclic of order `m` and the subgroup generated by `g ^ m` is a `p`-group of order `p ^ a`, and the
two are complementary because their orders are coprime.

So the elementary subgroups of a finite group include all its cyclic subgroups: Brauer's induction
theorem, indexed by elementary subgroups, refines Artin's, indexed by cyclic ones. -/
